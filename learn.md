# Quickstart

This quickstart takes you from a simple setup to a fully functional AI agent in just a few minutes.

## Build a basic agent

Start by creating a simple agent that can answer questions and call tools. The agent will use Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its language model, a basic weather function as a tool, and a simple prompt to guide its behavior.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
    tools=[get_weather],
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```

<Info>
  For this example, you will need to set up a [Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/) account and get an API key. Then, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal.
</Info>

## Build a real-world agent

Next, build a practical weather forecasting agent that demonstrates key production concepts:

1. **Detailed system prompts** for better agent behavior
2. **Create tools** that integrate with external data
3. **Model configuration** for consistent responses
4. **Structured output** for predictable results
5. **Conversational memory** for chat-like interactions
6. **Create and run the agent** create a fully functional agent

Let's walk through each step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the system prompt">
    The system prompt defines your agent’s role and behavior. Keep it specific and actionable:

    ```python wrap theme={null}
    SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.

    You have access to two tools:

    - get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location
    - get_user_location: use this to get the user's location

    If a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location. If you can tell from the question that they mean wherever they are, use the get_user_location tool to find their location."""
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create tools">
    [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) let a model interact with external systems by calling functions you define.
    Tools can depend on [runtime context](/oss/python/langchain/runtime) and also interact with [agent memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory).

    Notice below how the `get_user_location` tool uses runtime context:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime

    @tool
    def get_weather_for_location(city: str) -> str:
        """Get weather for a given city."""
        return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

    @dataclass
    class Context:
        """Custom runtime context schema."""
        user_id: str

    @tool
    def get_user_location(runtime: ToolRuntime[Context]) -> str:
        """Retrieve user information based on user ID."""
        user_id = runtime.context.user_id
        return "Florida" if user_id == "1" else "SF"
    ```

    <Tip>
      Tools should be well-documented: their name, description, and argument names become part of the model's prompt.
      LangChain's [`@tool` decorator](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/tools/#langchain.tools.tool) adds metadata and enables runtime injection via the `ToolRuntime` parameter.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your model">
    Set up your [language model](/oss/python/langchain/models) with the right [parameters](/oss/python/langchain/models#parameters) for your use case:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

    model = init_chat_model(
        "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
        temperature=0.5,
        timeout=10,
        max_tokens=1000
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define response format">
    Optionally, define a structured response format if you need the agent responses to match
    a specific schema.

    ```python  theme={null}
    from dataclasses import dataclass

    # We use a dataclass here, but Pydantic models are also supported.
    @dataclass
    class ResponseFormat:
        """Response schema for the agent."""
        # A punny response (always required)
        punny_response: str
        # Any interesting information about the weather if available
        weather_conditions: str | None = None
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add memory">
    Add [memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory) to your agent to maintain state across interactions. This allows
    the agent to remember previous conversations and context.

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

    checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
    ```

    <Info>
      In production, use a persistent checkpointer that saves to a database.
      See [Add and manage memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory#manage-short-term-memory) for more details.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and run the agent">
    Now assemble your agent with all the components and run it!

    ```python  theme={null}
    agent = create_agent(
        model=model,
        system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        tools=[get_user_location, get_weather_for_location],
        context_schema=Context,
        response_format=ResponseFormat,
        checkpointer=checkpointer
    )

    # `thread_id` is a unique identifier for a given conversation.
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

    response = agent.invoke(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather outside?"}]},
        config=config,
        context=Context(user_id="1")
    )

    print(response['structured_response'])
    # ResponseFormat(
    #     punny_response="Florida is still having a 'sun-derful' day! The sunshine is playing 'ray-dio' hits all day long! I'd say it's the perfect weather for some 'solar-bration'! If you were hoping for rain, I'm afraid that idea is all 'washed up' - the forecast remains 'clear-ly' brilliant!",
    #     weather_conditions="It's always sunny in Florida!"
    # )


    # Note that we can continue the conversation using the same `thread_id`.
    response = agent.invoke(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "thank you!"}]},
        config=config,
        context=Context(user_id="1")
    )

    print(response['structured_response'])
    # ResponseFormat(
    #     punny_response="You're 'thund-erfully' welcome! It's always a 'breeze' to help you stay 'current' with the weather. I'm just 'cloud'-ing around waiting to 'shower' you with more forecasts whenever you need them. Have a 'sun-sational' day in the Florida sunshine!",
    #     weather_conditions=None
    # )
    ```

# Agents

Agents combine language models with [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) to create systems that can reason about tasks, decide which tools to use, and iteratively work towards solutions.

[`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) provides a production-ready agent implementation.

[An LLM Agent runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/).
An agent runs until a stop condition is met - i.e., when the model emits a final output or an iteration limit is reached.

  }
}%%

```

<Info>
  [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) builds a **graph**-based agent runtime using [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview). A graph consists of nodes (steps) and edges (connections) that define how your agent processes information. The agent moves through this graph, executing nodes like the model node (which calls the model), the tools node (which executes tools), or middleware.

  Learn more about the [Graph API](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api).
</Info>

## Core components

### Model

The [model](/oss/python/langchain/models) is the reasoning engine of your agent. It can be specified in multiple ways, supporting both static and dynamic model selection.

#### Static model

Static models are configured once when creating the agent and remain unchanged throughout execution. This is the most common and straightforward approach.

To initialize a static model from a <Tooltip tip="A string that follows the format `provider:model` (e.g. openai:gpt-5)" cta="See mappings" href="https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model(model_provider)">model identifier string</Tooltip>:

```python wrap theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent

agent = create_agent(
    "openai:gpt-5",
    tools=tools
)
```

<Tip>
  Model identifier strings support automatic inference (e.g., `"gpt-5"` will be inferred as `"openai:gpt-5"`). Refer to the [reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model\(model_provider\)) to see a full list of model identifier string mappings.
</Tip>

For more control over the model configuration, initialize a model instance directly using the provider package. In this example, we use [`ChatOpenAI`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/ChatOpenAI/). See [Chat models](/oss/python/integrations/chat) for other available chat model classes.

```python wrap theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-5",
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=1000,
    timeout=30
    # ... (other params)
)
agent = create_agent(model, tools=tools)
```

Model instances give you complete control over configuration. Use them when you need to set specific [parameters](/oss/python/langchain/models#parameters) like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `timeouts`, `base_url`, and other provider-specific settings. Refer to the [reference](/oss/python/integrations/providers/all_providers) to see available params and methods on your model.

#### Dynamic model

Dynamic models are selected at <Tooltip tip="The execution environment of your agent, containing immutable configuration and contextual data that persists throughout the agent's execution (e.g., user IDs, session details, or application-specific configuration).">runtime</Tooltip> based on the current <Tooltip tip="The data that flows through your agent's execution, including messages, custom fields, and any information that needs to be tracked and potentially modified during processing (e.g., user preferences or tool usage stats).">state</Tooltip> and context. This enables sophisticated routing logic and cost optimization.

To use a dynamic model, create middleware using the [`@wrap_model_call`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.wrap_model_call) decorator that modifies the model in the request:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import wrap_model_call, ModelRequest, ModelResponse


basic_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
advanced_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

@wrap_model_call
def dynamic_model_selection(request: ModelRequest, handler) -> ModelResponse:
    """Choose model based on conversation complexity."""
    message_count = len(request.state["messages"])

    if message_count > 10:
        # Use an advanced model for longer conversations
        model = advanced_model
    else:
        model = basic_model

    request.model = model
    return handler(request)

agent = create_agent(
    model=basic_model,  # Default model
    tools=tools,
    middleware=[dynamic_model_selection]
)
```

<Warning>
  Pre-bound models (models with [`bind_tools`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.bind_tools) already called) are not supported when using structured output. If you need dynamic model selection with structured output, ensure the models passed to the middleware are not pre-bound.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For model configuration details, see [Models](/oss/python/langchain/models). For dynamic model selection patterns, see [Dynamic model in middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware#dynamic-model).
</Tip>

### Tools

Tools give agents the ability to take actions. Agents go beyond simple model-only tool binding by facilitating:

* Multiple tool calls in sequence (triggered by a single prompt)
* Parallel tool calls when appropriate
* Dynamic tool selection based on previous results
* Tool retry logic and error handling
* State persistence across tool calls

For more information, see [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).

#### Defining tools

Pass a list of tools to the agent.

```python wrap theme={null}
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain.agents import create_agent


@tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search for information."""
    return f"Results for: {query}"

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather information for a location."""
    return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 72°F"

agent = create_agent(model, tools=[search, get_weather])
```

If an empty tool list is provided, the agent will consist of a single LLM node without tool-calling capabilities.

#### Tool error handling

To customize how tool errors are handled, use the [`@wrap_tool_call`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.wrap_tool_call) decorator to create middleware:

```python wrap theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import wrap_tool_call
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage


@wrap_tool_call
def handle_tool_errors(request, handler):
    """Handle tool execution errors with custom messages."""
    try:
        return handler(request)
    except Exception as e:
        # Return a custom error message to the model
        return ToolMessage(
            content=f"Tool error: Please check your input and try again. ({str(e)})",
            tool_call_id=request.tool_call["id"]
        )

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[search, get_weather],
    middleware=[handle_tool_errors]
)
```

The agent will return a [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) with the custom error message when a tool fails:

```python  theme={null}
[
    ...
    ToolMessage(
        content="Tool error: Please check your input and try again. (division by zero)",
        tool_call_id="..."
    ),
    ...
]
```

#### Tool use in the ReAct loop

Agents follow the ReAct ("Reasoning + Acting") pattern, alternating between brief reasoning steps with targeted tool calls and feeding the resulting observations into subsequent decisions until they can deliver a final answer.

<Accordion title="Example of ReAct loop">
  Prompt: Identify the current most popular wireless headphones and verify availability.

  ```
  ================================ Human Message =================================

  Find the most popular wireless headphones right now and check if they're in stock
  ```

  * **Reasoning**: "Popularity is time-sensitive, I need to use the provided search tool."
  * **Acting**: Call `search_products("wireless headphones")`

  ```
  ================================== Ai Message ==================================
  Tool Calls:
    search_products (call_abc123)
   Call ID: call_abc123
    Args:
      query: wireless headphones
  ```

  ```
  ================================= Tool Message =================================

  Found 5 products matching "wireless headphones". Top 5 results: WH-1000XM5, ...
  ```

  * **Reasoning**: "I need to confirm availability for the top-ranked item before answering."
  * **Acting**: Call `check_inventory("WH-1000XM5")`

  ```
  ================================== Ai Message ==================================
  Tool Calls:
    check_inventory (call_def456)
   Call ID: call_def456
    Args:
      product_id: WH-1000XM5
  ```

  ```
  ================================= Tool Message =================================

  Product WH-1000XM5: 10 units in stock
  ```

  * **Reasoning**: "I have the most popular model and its stock status. I can now answer the user's question."
  * **Acting**: Produce final answer

  ```
  ================================== Ai Message ==================================

  I found wireless headphones (model WH-1000XM5) with 10 units in stock...
  ```
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  To learn more about tools, see [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).
</Tip>

### System prompt

You can shape how your agent approaches tasks by providing a prompt. The [`system_prompt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent\(system_prompt\)) parameter can be provided as a string:

```python wrap theme={null}
agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant. Be concise and accurate."
)
```

When no [`system_prompt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent\(system_prompt\)) is provided, the agent will infer its task from the messages directly.

#### Dynamic system prompt

For more advanced use cases where you need to modify the system prompt based on runtime context or agent state, you can use [middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware).

The [`@dynamic_prompt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.dynamic_prompt) decorator creates middleware that generates system prompts dynamically based on the model request:

```python wrap theme={null}
from typing import TypedDict

from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest


class Context(TypedDict):
    user_role: str

@dynamic_prompt
def user_role_prompt(request: ModelRequest) -> str:
    """Generate system prompt based on user role."""
    user_role = request.runtime.context.get("user_role", "user")
    base_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."

    if user_role == "expert":
        return f"{base_prompt} Provide detailed technical responses."
    elif user_role == "beginner":
        return f"{base_prompt} Explain concepts simply and avoid jargon."

    return base_prompt

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[web_search],
    middleware=[user_role_prompt],
    context_schema=Context
)

# The system prompt will be set dynamically based on context
result = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain machine learning"}]},
    context={"user_role": "expert"}
)
```

<Tip>
  For more details on message types and formatting, see [Messages](/oss/python/langchain/messages). For comprehensive middleware documentation, see [Middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware).
</Tip>

## Invocation

You can invoke an agent by passing an update to its [`State`](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state). All agents include a [sequence of messages](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api#messagesstate) in their state; to invoke the agent, pass a new message:

```python  theme={null}
result = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?"}]}
)
```

For streaming steps and / or tokens from the agent, refer to the [streaming](/oss/python/langchain/streaming) guide.

Otherwise, the agent follows the LangGraph [Graph API](/oss/python/langgraph/use-graph-api) and supports all associated methods.

## Advanced concepts

### Structured output

In some situations, you may want the agent to return an output in a specific format. LangChain provides strategies for structured output via the [`response_format`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.ModelRequest\(response_format\)) parameter.

#### ToolStrategy

`ToolStrategy` uses artificial tool calling to generate structured output. This works with any model that supports tool calling:

```python wrap theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy


class ContactInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str
    phone: str

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=[search_tool],
    response_format=ToolStrategy(ContactInfo)
)

result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract contact info from: John Doe, john@example.com, (555) 123-4567"}]
})

result["structured_response"]
# ContactInfo(name='John Doe', email='john@example.com', phone='(555) 123-4567')
```

#### ProviderStrategy

`ProviderStrategy` uses the model provider's native structured output generation. This is more reliable but only works with providers that support native structured output (e.g., OpenAI):

```python wrap theme={null}
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ProviderStrategy

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    response_format=ProviderStrategy(ContactInfo)
)
```

<Note>
  As of `langchain 1.0`, simply passing a schema (e.g., `response_format=ContactInfo`) is no longer supported. You must explicitly use `ToolStrategy` or `ProviderStrategy`.
</Note>

<Tip>
  To learn about structured output, see [Structured output](/oss/python/langchain/structured-output).
</Tip>

### Memory

Agents maintain conversation history automatically through the message state. You can also configure the agent to use a custom state schema to remember additional information during the conversation.

Information stored in the state can be thought of as the [short-term memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory) of the agent:

Custom state schemas must extend [`AgentState`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.AgentState) as a `TypedDict`.

There are two ways to define custom state:

1. Via [middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware) (preferred)
2. Via [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) on [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent)

<Note>
  Defining custom state via middleware is preferred over defining it via [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) on [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) because it allows you to keep state extensions conceptually scoped to the relevant middleware and tools.

  [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) is still supported for backwards compatibility on [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent).
</Note>

#### Defining state via middleware

Use middleware to define custom state when your custom state needs to be accessed by specific middleware hooks and tools attached to said middleware.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import AgentState
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware


class CustomState(AgentState):
    user_preferences: dict

class CustomMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    state_schema = CustomState
    tools = [tool1, tool2]

    def before_model(self, state: CustomState, runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        ...

agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    middleware=[CustomMiddleware()]
)

# The agent can now track additional state beyond messages
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I prefer technical explanations"}],
    "user_preferences": {"style": "technical", "verbosity": "detailed"},
})
```

#### Defining state via `state_schema`

Use the [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) parameter as a shortcut to define custom state that is only used in tools.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import AgentState


class CustomState(AgentState):
    user_preferences: dict

agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[tool1, tool2],
    state_schema=CustomState
)
# The agent can now track additional state beyond messages
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I prefer technical explanations"}],
    "user_preferences": {"style": "technical", "verbosity": "detailed"},
})
```

<Note>
  As of `langchain 1.0`, custom state schemas **must** be `TypedDict` types. Pydantic models and dataclasses are no longer supported. See the [v1 migration guide](/oss/python/migrate/langchain-v1#state-type-restrictions) for more details.
</Note>

  To learn more about memory, see [Memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory). For information on implementing long-term memory that persists across sessions, see [Long-term memory](/oss/python/langchain/long-term-memory).
</Tip>

### Streaming

We've seen how the agent can be called with `invoke` to get a final response. If the agent executes multiple steps, this may take a while. To show intermediate progress, we can stream back messages as they occur.

```python  theme={null}
for chunk in agent.stream({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Search for AI news and summarize the findings"}]
}, stream_mode="values"):
    # Each chunk contains the full state at that point
    latest_message = chunk["messages"][-1]
    if latest_message.content:
        print(f"Agent: {latest_message.content}")
    elif latest_message.tool_calls:
        print(f"Calling tools: {[tc['name'] for tc in latest_message.tool_calls]}")
```

<Tip>
  For more details on streaming, see [Streaming](/oss/python/langchain/streaming).
</Tip>

### Middleware

[Middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware) provides powerful extensibility for customizing agent behavior at different stages of execution. You can use middleware to:

* Process state before the model is called (e.g., message trimming, context injection)
* Modify or validate the model's response (e.g., guardrails, content filtering)
* Handle tool execution errors with custom logic
* Implement dynamic model selection based on state or context
* Add custom logging, monitoring, or analytics

Middleware integrates seamlessly into the agent's execution graph, allowing you to intercept and modify data flow at key points without changing the core agent logic.

<Tip>
  For comprehensive middleware documentation including decorators like [`@before_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.before_model), [`@after_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.after_model), and [`@wrap_tool_call`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.wrap_tool_call), see [Middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware).

# Models

[LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are powerful AI tools that can interpret and generate text like humans. They're versatile enough to write content, translate languages, summarize, and answer questions without needing specialized training for each task.

In addition to text generation, many models support:

* <Icon icon="hammer" size={16} /> [Tool calling](#tool-calling) - calling external tools (like databases queries or API calls) and use results in their responses.
* <Icon icon="shapes" size={16} /> [Structured output](#structured-outputs) - where the model's response is constrained to follow a defined format.
* <Icon icon="image" size={16} /> [Multimodality](#multimodal) - process and return data other than text, such as images, audio, and video.
* <Icon icon="brain" size={16} /> [Reasoning](#reasoning) - models perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.

Models are the reasoning engine of [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents). They drive the agent's decision-making process, determining which tools to call, how to interpret results, and when to provide a final answer.

The quality and capabilities of the model you choose directly impact your agent's reliability and performance. Different models excel at different tasks - some are better at following complex instructions, others at structured reasoning, and some support larger context windows for handling more information.

LangChain's standard model interfaces give you access to many different provider integrations, which makes it easy to experiment with and switch between models to find the best fit for your case.

<Info>
  For provider-specific integration information and capabilities, see the provider's [chat model page](/oss/python/integrations/chat).
</Info>

## Basic usage

Models can be utilized in two ways:

1. **With agents** - Models can be dynamically specified when creating an [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents#model).
2. **Standalone** - Models can be called directly (outside of the agent loop) for tasks like text generation, classification, or extraction without the need for an agent framework.

The same model interface works in both contexts, which gives you the flexibility to start simple and scale up to more complex agent-based workflows as needed.

### Initialize a model

The easiest way to get started with a standalone model in LangChain is to use [`init_chat_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model) to initialize one from a [chat model provider](/oss/python/integrations/chat) of your choice (examples below):

## Parameters

A chat model takes parameters that can be used to configure its behavior. The full set of supported parameters varies by model and provider, but standard ones include:

<ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
  The name or identifier of the specific model you want to use with a provider.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="api_key" type="string">
  The key required for authenticating with the model's provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model. Often accessed by setting an <Tooltip tip="A variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice.">environment variable</Tooltip>.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" type="number">
  Controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher number makes responses more creative; lower ones make them more deterministic.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="timeout" type="number">
  The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_tokens" type="number">
  Limits the total number of <Tooltip tip="The basic unit that a model reads and generates. Providers may define them differently, but in general, they can represent a whole or part of word.">tokens</Tooltip> in the response, effectively controlling how long the output can be.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_retries" type="number">
  The maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.
</ParamField>

Using [`init_chat_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model), pass these parameters as inline <Tooltip tip="Arbitrary keyword arguments" cta="Learn more" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_args_kwargs.asp">`**kwargs`</Tooltip>:

```python Initialize using model parameters theme={null}
model = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
    # Kwargs passed to the model:
    temperature=0.7,
    timeout=30,
    max_tokens=1000,
)
```

<Info>
  Each chat model integration may have additional params used to control provider-specific functionality. For example, [`ChatOpenAI`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/ChatOpenAI/) has `use_responses_api` to dictate whether to use the OpenAI Responses or Completions API.

  To find all the parameters supported by a given chat model, head to the [chat model integrations](/oss/python/integrations/chat) page.
</Info>

***

## Invocation

A chat model must be invoked to generate an output. There are three primary invocation methods, each suited to different use cases.

### Invoke

The most straightforward way to call a model is to use [`invoke()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.invoke) with a single message or a list of messages.

```python Single message theme={null}
response = model.invoke("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?")
print(response)
```

A list of messages can be provided to a model to represent conversation history. Each message has a role that models use to indicate who sent the message in the conversation. See the [messages](/oss/python/langchain/messages) guide for more detail on roles, types, and content.

```python Dictionary format theme={null}
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

conversation = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Translate: I love programming."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "J'adore la programmation."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Translate: I love building applications."}
]

response = model.invoke(conversation)
print(response)  # AIMessage("J'adore créer des applications.")
```

```python Message objects theme={null}
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

conversation = [
    SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."),
    HumanMessage("Translate: I love programming."),
    AIMessage("J'adore la programmation."),
    HumanMessage("Translate: I love building applications.")
]

response = model.invoke(conversation)
print(response)  # AIMessage("J'adore créer des applications.")
```

### Stream

Most models can stream their output content while it is being generated. By displaying output progressively, streaming significantly improves user experience, particularly for longer responses.

Calling [`stream()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.stream) returns an <Tooltip tip="An object that progressively provides access to each item of a collection, in order.">iterator</Tooltip> that yields output chunks as they are produced. You can use a loop to process each chunk in real-time:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Basic text streaming theme={null}
  for chunk in model.stream("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?"):
      print(chunk.text, end="|", flush=True)
  ```

  ```python Stream tool calls, reasoning, and other content theme={null}
  for chunk in model.stream("What color is the sky?"):
      for block in chunk.content_blocks:
          if block["type"] == "reasoning" and (reasoning := block.get("reasoning")):
              print(f"Reasoning: {reasoning}")
          elif block["type"] == "tool_call_chunk":
              print(f"Tool call chunk: {block}")
          elif block["type"] == "text":
              print(block["text"])
          else:
              ...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As opposed to [`invoke()`](#invoke), which returns a single [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) after the model has finished generating its full response, `stream()` returns multiple [`AIMessageChunk`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessageChunk) objects, each containing a portion of the output text. Importantly, each chunk in a stream is designed to be gathered into a full message via summation:

```python Construct an AIMessage theme={null}
full = None  # None | AIMessageChunk
for chunk in model.stream("What color is the sky?"):
    full = chunk if full is None else full + chunk
    print(full.text)

# The
# The sky
# The sky is
# The sky is typically
# The sky is typically blue
# ...

print(full.content_blocks)
# [{"type": "text", "text": "The sky is typically blue..."}]
```

The resulting message can be treated the same as a message that was generated with [`invoke()`](#invoke) - for example, it can be aggregated into a message history and passed back to the model as conversational context.

<Warning>
  Streaming only works if all steps in the program know how to process a stream of chunks. For instance, an application that isn't streaming-capable would be one that needs to store the entire output in memory before it can be processed.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Advanced streaming topics">
  <Accordion title="&#x22;Auto-streaming&#x22; chat models">
    LangChain simplifies streaming from chat models by automatically enabling streaming mode in certain cases, even when you're not explicitly calling the streaming methods. This is particularly useful when you use the non-streaming invoke method but still want to stream the entire application, including intermediate results from the chat model.

    In [LangGraph agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents), for example, you can call `model.invoke()` within nodes, but LangChain will automatically delegate to streaming if running in a streaming mode.

    #### How it works

    When you `invoke()` a chat model, LangChain will automatically switch to an internal streaming mode if it detects that you are trying to stream the overall application. The result of the invocation will be the same as far as the code that was using invoke is concerned; however, while the chat model is being streamed, LangChain will take care of invoking [`on_llm_new_token`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/callbacks/#langchain_core.callbacks.base.AsyncCallbackHandler.on_llm_new_token) events in LangChain's callback system.

    Callback events allow LangGraph `stream()` and [`astream_events()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.astream_events) to surface the chat model's output in real-time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streaming events">
    LangChain chat models can also stream semantic events using [`astream_events()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.astream_events).

    This simplifies filtering based on event types and other metadata, and will aggregate the full message in the background. See below for an example.

    ```python  theme={null}
    async for event in model.astream_events("Hello"):

        if event["event"] == "on_chat_model_start":
            print(f"Input: {event['data']['input']}")

        elif event["event"] == "on_chat_model_stream":
            print(f"Token: {event['data']['chunk'].text}")

        elif event["event"] == "on_chat_model_end":
            print(f"Full message: {event['data']['output'].text}")

        else:
            pass
    ```

    ```txt  theme={null}
    Input: Hello
    Token: Hi
    Token:  there
    Token: !
    Token:  How
    Token:  can
    Token:  I
    ...
    Full message: Hi there! How can I help today?
    ```

    <Tip>
      See the [`astream_events()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.astream_events) reference for event types and other details.

### Batch

Batching a collection of independent requests to a model can significantly improve performance and reduce costs, as the processing can be done in parallel:

```python Batch theme={null}
responses = model.batch([
    "Why do parrots have colorful feathers?",
    "How do airplanes fly?",
    "What is quantum computing?"
])
for response in responses:
    print(response)
```

<Note>
  This section describes a chat model method [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch), which parallelizes model calls client-side.

  It is **distinct** from batch APIs supported by inference providers, such as [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) or [Anthropic](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing#message-batches-api).
</Note>

By default, [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch) will only return the final output for the entire batch. If you want to receive the output for each individual input as it finishes generating, you can stream results with [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed):

```python Yield batch responses upon completion theme={null}
for response in model.batch_as_completed([
    "Why do parrots have colorful feathers?",
    "How do airplanes fly?",
    "What is quantum computing?"
]):
    print(response)
```

<Note>
  When using [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed), results may arrive out of order. Each includes the input index for matching to reconstruct the original order as needed.
</Note>

<Tip>
  When processing a large number of inputs using [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch) or [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed), you may want to control the maximum number of parallel calls. This can be done by setting the [`max_concurrency`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.max_concurrency) attribute in the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) dictionary.

  ```python Batch with max concurrency theme={null}
  model.batch(
      list_of_inputs,
      config={
          'max_concurrency': 5,  # Limit to 5 parallel calls
      }
  )
  ```

## Tool calling

Models can request to call tools that perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, searching the web, or running code. Tools are pairings of:

1. A schema, including the name of the tool, a description, and/or argument definitions (often a JSON schema)
2. A function or <Tooltip tip="A method that can suspend execution and resume at a later time">coroutine</Tooltip> to execute.

<Note>
  You may hear the term "function calling". We use this interchangeably with "tool calling".
</Note>

To make tools that you have defined available for use by a model, you must bind them using [`bind_tools()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.bind_tools). In subsequent invocations, the model can choose to call any of the bound tools as needed.

Some model providers offer built-in tools that can be enabled via model or invocation parameters (e.g. [`ChatOpenAI`](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai), [`ChatAnthropic`](/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic)). Check the respective [provider reference](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) for details.

<Tip>
  See the [tools guide](/oss/python/langchain/tools) for details and other options for creating tools.
</Tip>

```python Binding user tools theme={null}
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather at a location."""
    return f"It's sunny in {location}."


model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])  # [!code highlight]

response = model_with_tools.invoke("What's the weather like in Boston?")
for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
    # View tool calls made by the model
    print(f"Tool: {tool_call['name']}")
    print(f"Args: {tool_call['args']}")
```

When binding user-defined tools, the model's response includes a **request** to execute a tool. When using a model separately from an [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents), it is up to you to perform the requested action and return the result back to the model for use in subsequent reasoning. Note that when using an [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents), the agent loop will handle the tool execution loop for you.

Below, we show some common ways you can use tool calling.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tool execution loop" icon="arrow-rotate-right">
    When a model returns tool calls, you need to execute the tools and pass the results back to the model. This creates a conversation loop where the model can use tool results to generate its final response. LangChain includes [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents) abstractions that handle this orchestration for you.

    Here's a simple example of how to do this:

    ```python Tool execution loop theme={null}
    # Bind (potentially multiple) tools to the model
    model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])

    # Step 1: Model generates tool calls
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Boston?"}]
    ai_msg = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    messages.append(ai_msg)

    # Step 2: Execute tools and collect results
    for tool_call in ai_msg.tool_calls:
        # Execute the tool with the generated arguments
        tool_result = get_weather.invoke(tool_call)
        messages.append(tool_result)

    # Step 3: Pass results back to model for final response
    final_response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    print(final_response.text)
    # "The current weather in Boston is 72°F and sunny."
    ```

    Each [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) returned by the tool includes a `tool_call_id` that matches the original tool call, helping the model correlate results with requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forcing tool calls" icon="asterisk">
    By default, the model has the freedom to choose which bound tool to use based on the user's input. However, you might want to force choosing a tool, ensuring the model uses either a particular tool or **any** tool from a given list:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Force use of any tool theme={null}
      model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool_1], tool_choice="any")
      ```

      ```python Force use of specific tools theme={null}
      model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool_1], tool_choice="tool_1")
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parallel tool calls" icon="layer-group">
    Many models support calling multiple tools in parallel when appropriate. This allows the model to gather information from different sources simultaneously.

    ```python Parallel tool calls theme={null}
    model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])

    response = model_with_tools.invoke(
        "What's the weather in Boston and Tokyo?"
    )


    # The model may generate multiple tool calls
    print(response.tool_calls)
    # [
    #   {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'Boston'}, 'id': 'call_1'},
    #   {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'Tokyo'}, 'id': 'call_2'},
    # ]


    # Execute all tools (can be done in parallel with async)
    results = []
    for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
        if tool_call['name'] == 'get_weather':
            result = get_weather.invoke(tool_call)
        ...
        results.append(result)
    ```

    The model intelligently determines when parallel execution is appropriate based on the independence of the requested operations.

    <Tip>
      Most models supporting tool calling enable parallel tool calls by default. Some (including [OpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai) and [Anthropic](/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic)) allow you to disable this feature. To do this, set `parallel_tool_calls=False`:

      ```python  theme={null}
      model.bind_tools([get_weather], parallel_tool_calls=False)
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streaming tool calls" icon="rss">
    When streaming responses, tool calls are progressively built through [`ToolCallChunk`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolCallChunk). This allows you to see tool calls as they're being generated rather than waiting for the complete response.

    ```python Streaming tool calls theme={null}
    for chunk in model_with_tools.stream(
        "What's the weather in Boston and Tokyo?"
    ):
        # Tool call chunks arrive progressively
        for tool_chunk in chunk.tool_call_chunks:
            if name := tool_chunk.get("name"):
                print(f"Tool: {name}")
            if id_ := tool_chunk.get("id"):
                print(f"ID: {id_}")
            if args := tool_chunk.get("args"):
                print(f"Args: {args}")

    # Output:
    # Tool: get_weather
    # ID: call_SvMlU1TVIZugrFLckFE2ceRE
    # Args: {"lo
    # Args: catio
    # Args: n": "B
    # Args: osto
    # Args: n"}
    # Tool: get_weather
    # ID: call_QMZdy6qInx13oWKE7KhuhOLR
    # Args: {"lo
    # Args: catio
    # Args: n": "T
    # Args: okyo
    # Args: "}
    ```

    You can accumulate chunks to build complete tool calls:

    ```python Accumulate tool calls theme={null}
    gathered = None
    for chunk in model_with_tools.stream("What's the weather in Boston?"):
        gathered = chunk if gathered is None else gathered + chunk
        print(gathered.tool_calls)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

***

## Structured outputs

Models can be requested to provide their response in a format matching a given schema. This is useful for ensuring the output can be easily parsed and used in subsequent processing. LangChain supports multiple schema types and methods for enforcing structured outputs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pydantic">
    [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#basic-model-usage) provide the richest feature set with field validation, descriptions, and nested structures.

    ```python  theme={null}
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

    class Movie(BaseModel):
        """A movie with details."""
        title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the movie")
        year: int = Field(..., description="The year the movie was released")
        director: str = Field(..., description="The director of the movie")
        rating: float = Field(..., description="The movie's rating out of 10")

    model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(Movie)
    response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
    print(response)  # Movie(title="Inception", year=2010, director="Christopher Nolan", rating=8.8)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypedDict">
    `TypedDict` provides a simpler alternative using Python's built-in typing, ideal when you don't need runtime validation.

    ```python  theme={null}
    from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated

    class MovieDict(TypedDict):
        """A movie with details."""
        title: Annotated[str, ..., "The title of the movie"]
        year: Annotated[int, ..., "The year the movie was released"]
        director: Annotated[str, ..., "The director of the movie"]
        rating: Annotated[float, ..., "The movie's rating out of 10"]

    model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(MovieDict)
    response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
    print(response)  # {'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010, 'director': 'Christopher Nolan', 'rating': 8.8}
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JSON Schema">
    For maximum control or interoperability, you can provide a raw JSON Schema.

    ```python  theme={null}
    import json

    json_schema = {
        "title": "Movie",
        "description": "A movie with details",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the movie"
            },
            "year": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "The year the movie was released"
            },
            "director": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The director of the movie"
            },
            "rating": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The movie's rating out of 10"
            }
        },
        "required": ["title", "year", "director", "rating"]
    }

    model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(
        json_schema,
        method="json_schema",
    )
    response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
    print(response)  # {'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010, ...}
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  **Key considerations for structured outputs:**

  * **Method parameter**: Some providers support different methods (`'json_schema'`, `'function_calling'`, `'json_mode'`)
    * `'json_schema'` typically refers to dedicated structured output features offered by a provider
    * `'function_calling'` derives structured output by forcing a [tool call](#tool-calling) following the given schema
    * `'json_mode'` is a precursor to `'json_schema'` offered by some providers- it generates valid json, but the schema must be described in the prompt
  * **Include raw**: Use `include_raw=True` to get both the parsed output and the raw AI message
  * **Validation**: Pydantic models provide automatic validation, while `TypedDict` and JSON Schema require manual validation
</Note>

<Accordion title="Example: Message output alongside parsed structure">
  It can be useful to return the raw [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) object alongside the parsed representation to access response metadata such as [token counts](#token-usage). To do this, set [`include_raw=True`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.with_structured_output\(include_raw\)) when calling [`with_structured_output`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.with_structured_output):

  ```python  theme={null}
  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

  class Movie(BaseModel):
      """A movie with details."""
      title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the movie")
      year: int = Field(..., description="The year the movie was released")
      director: str = Field(..., description="The director of the movie")
      rating: float = Field(..., description="The movie's rating out of 10")

  model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(Movie, include_raw=True)  # [!code highlight]
  response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
  response
  # {
  #     "raw": AIMessage(...),
  #     "parsed": Movie(title=..., year=..., ...),
  #     "parsing_error": None,
  # }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Nested structures">
  Schemas can be nested:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Pydantic BaseModel theme={null}
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

    class Actor(BaseModel):
        name: str
        role: str

    class MovieDetails(BaseModel):
        title: str
        year: int
        cast: list[Actor]
        genres: list[str]
        budget: float | None = Field(None, description="Budget in millions USD")

    model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(MovieDetails)
    ```

    ```python TypedDict theme={null}
    from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

    class Actor(TypedDict):
        name: str
        role: str

    class MovieDetails(TypedDict):
        title: str
        year: int
        cast: list[Actor]
        genres: list[str]
        budget: Annotated[float | None, ..., "Budget in millions USD"]

    model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(MovieDetails)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

## Supported models

LangChain supports all major model providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and more. Each provider offers a variety of models with different capabilities. For a full list of supported models in LangChain, see the [integrations page](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview).

***

## Advanced topics

### Multimodal

Certain models can process and return non-textual data such as images, audio, and video. You can pass non-textual data to a model by providing [content blocks](/oss/python/langchain/messages#message-content).

<Tip>
  All LangChain chat models with underlying multimodal capabilities support:

  1. Data in the cross-provider standard format (see [our messages guide](/oss/python/langchain/messages))
  2. OpenAI [chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) format
  3. Any format that is native to that specific provider (e.g., Anthropic models accept Anthropic native format)
</Tip>

See the [multimodal section](/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal) of the messages guide for details.

<Tooltip tip="Not all LLMs are made equally!" cta="See reference" href="https://models.dev/">Some models</Tooltip> can return multimodal data as part of their response. If invoked to do so, the resulting [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) will have content blocks with multimodal types.

```python Multimodal output theme={null}
response = model.invoke("Create a picture of a cat")
print(response.content_blocks)
# [
#     {"type": "text", "text": "Here's a picture of a cat"},
#     {"type": "image", "base64": "...", "mime_type": "image/jpeg"},
# ]
```

See the [integrations page](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) for details on specific providers.

### Reasoning

Newer models are capable of performing multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. This involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.

**If supported by the underlying model,** you can surface this reasoning process to better understand how the model arrived at its final answer.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Stream reasoning output theme={null}
  for chunk in model.stream("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?"):
      reasoning_steps = [r for r in chunk.content_blocks if r["type"] == "reasoning"]
      print(reasoning_steps if reasoning_steps else chunk.text)
  ```

  ```python Complete reasoning output theme={null}
  response = model.invoke("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?")
  reasoning_steps = [b for b in response.content_blocks if b["type"] == "reasoning"]
  print(" ".join(step["reasoning"] for step in reasoning_steps))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Depending on the model, you can sometimes specify the level of effort it should put into reasoning. Similarly, you can request that the model turn off reasoning entirely. This may take the form of categorical "tiers" of reasoning (e.g., `'low'` or `'high'`) or integer token budgets.

For details, see the [integrations page](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) or [reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/) for your respective chat model.

### Local models

LangChain supports running models locally on your own hardware. This is useful for scenarios where either data privacy is critical, you want to invoke a custom model, or when you want to avoid the costs incurred when using a cloud-based model.

[Ollama](/oss/python/integrations/chat/ollama) is one of the easiest ways to run models locally. See the full list of local integrations on the [integrations page](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview).

### Prompt caching

Many providers offer prompt caching features to reduce latency and cost on repeat processing of the same tokens. These features can be **implicit** or **explicit**:

* **Implicit prompt caching:** providers will automatically pass on cost savings if a request hits a cache. Examples: [OpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai) and [Gemini](/oss/python/integrations/chat/google_generative_ai) (Gemini 2.5 and above).
* **Explicit caching:** providers allow you to manually indicate cache points for greater control or to guarantee cost savings. Examples: [`ChatOpenAI`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/ChatOpenAI/) (via `prompt_cache_key`), Anthropic's [`AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware`](/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic#prompt-caching) and [`cache_control`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic#prompt-caching) options, [AWS Bedrock](/oss/python/integrations/chat/bedrock#prompt-caching), [Gemini](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/google_genai/chat_models/langchain_google_genai.chat_models.ChatGoogleGenerativeAI.html).

<Warning>
  Prompt caching is often only engaged above a minimum input token threshold. See [provider pages](/oss/python/integrations/chat) for details.
</Warning>

Cache usage will be reflected in the [usage metadata](/oss/python/langchain/messages#token-usage) of the model response.

### Server-side tool use

Some providers support server-side [tool-calling](#tool-calling) loops: models can interact with web search, code interpreters, and other tools and analyze the results in a single conversational turn.

If a model invokes a tool server-side, the content of the response message will include content representing the invocation and result of the tool. Accessing the [content blocks](/oss/python/langchain/messages#standard-content-blocks) of the response will return the server-side tool calls and results in a provider-agnostic format:

```python Invoke with server-side tool use theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1-mini")

tool = {"type": "web_search"}
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool])

response = model_with_tools.invoke("What was a positive news story from today?")
response.content_blocks
```

```python Result expandable theme={null}
[
    {
        "type": "server_tool_call",
        "name": "web_search",
        "args": {
            "query": "positive news stories today",
            "type": "search"
        },
        "id": "ws_abc123"
    },
    {
        "type": "server_tool_result",
        "tool_call_id": "ws_abc123",
        "status": "success"
    },
    {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Here are some positive news stories from today...",
        "annotations": [
            {
                "end_index": 410,
                "start_index": 337,
                "title": "article title",
                "type": "citation",
                "url": "..."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

This represents a single conversational turn; there are no associated [ToolMessage](/oss/python/langchain/messages#tool-message) objects that need to be passed in as in client-side [tool-calling](#tool-calling).

See the [integration page](/oss/python/integrations/chat) for your given provider for available tools and usage details.

### Rate limiting

Many chat model providers impose a limit on the number of invocations that can be made in a given time period. If you hit a rate limit, you will typically receive a rate limit error response from the provider, and will need to wait before making more requests.

To help manage rate limits, chat model integrations accept a `rate_limiter` parameter that can be provided during initialization to control the rate at which requests are made.

<Accordion title="Initialize and use a rate limiter" icon="gauge-high">
  LangChain in comes with (an optional) built-in [`InMemoryRateLimiter`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/rate_limiters/#langchain_core.rate_limiters.InMemoryRateLimiter). This limiter is thread safe and can be shared by multiple threads in the same process.

  ```python Define a rate limiter theme={null}
  from langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter

  rate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(
      requests_per_second=0.1,  # 1 request every 10s
      check_every_n_seconds=0.1,  # Check every 100ms whether allowed to make a request
      max_bucket_size=10,  # Controls the maximum burst size.
  )

  model = init_chat_model(
      model="gpt-5",
      model_provider="openai",
      rate_limiter=rate_limiter  # [!code highlight]
  )
  ```

  <Warning>
    The provided rate limiter can only limit the number of requests per unit time. It will not help if you need to also limit based on the size of the requests.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

### Base URL or proxy

For many chat model integrations, you can configure the base URL for API requests, which allows you to use model providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs or to use a proxy server.

<Accordion title="Base URL" icon="link">
  Many model providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)). You can use [`init_chat_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model) with these providers by specifying the appropriate `base_url` parameter:

  ```python  theme={null}
  model = init_chat_model(
      model="MODEL_NAME",
      model_provider="openai",
      base_url="BASE_URL",
      api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
  )
  ```

  <Note>
    When using direct chat model class instantiation, the parameter name may vary by provider. Check the respective [reference](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) for details.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Proxy configuration" icon="shield">
  For deployments requiring HTTP proxies, some model integrations support proxy configuration:

  ```python  theme={null}
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

  model = ChatOpenAI(
      model="gpt-4o",
      openai_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
  )
  ```

  <Note>
    Proxy support varies by integration. Check the specific model provider's [reference](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) for proxy configuration options.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

### Log probabilities

Certain models can be configured to return token-level log probabilities representing the likelihood of a given token by setting the `logprobs` parameter when initializing the model:

```python  theme={null}
model = init_chat_model(
    model="gpt-4o",
    model_provider="openai"
).bind(logprobs=True)

response = model.invoke("Why do parrots talk?")
print(response.response_metadata["logprobs"])
```

### Token usage

A number of model providers return token usage information as part of the invocation response. When available, this information will be included on the [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) objects produced by the corresponding model. For more details, see the [messages](/oss/python/langchain/messages) guide.

<Note>
  Some provider APIs, notably OpenAI and Azure OpenAI chat completions, require users opt-in to receiving token usage data in streaming contexts. See the [streaming usage metadata](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai#streaming-usage-metadata) section of the integration guide for details.
</Note>

You can track aggregate token counts across models in an application using either a callback or context manager, as shown below:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Callback handler">
    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
    from langchain_core.callbacks import UsageMetadataCallbackHandler

    model_1 = init_chat_model(model="openai:gpt-4o-mini")
    model_2 = init_chat_model(model="anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest")

    callback = UsageMetadataCallbackHandler()
    result_1 = model_1.invoke("Hello", config={"callbacks": [callback]})
    result_2 = model_2.invoke("Hello", config={"callbacks": [callback]})
    callback.usage_metadata
    ```

    ```python  theme={null}
    {
        'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18': {
            'input_tokens': 8,
            'output_tokens': 10,

            'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}
        }

### Invocation config

When invoking a model, you can pass additional configuration through the `config` parameter using a [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) dictionary. This provides run-time control over execution behavior, callbacks, and metadata tracking.

Common configuration options include:

```python Invocation with config theme={null}
response = model.invoke(
    "Tell me a joke",
    config={
        "run_name": "joke_generation",      # Custom name for this run
        "tags": ["humor", "demo"],          # Tags for categorization
        "metadata": {"user_id": "123"},     # Custom metadata
        "callbacks": [my_callback_handler], # Callback handlers
    }
)
```

These configuration values are particularly useful when:

* Debugging with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) tracing
* Implementing custom logging or monitoring
* Controlling resource usage in production
* Tracking invocations across complex pipelines

<Accordion title="Key configuration attributes">
  <ParamField body="run_name" type="string">
    Identifies this specific invocation in logs and traces. Not inherited by sub-calls.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="tags" type="string[]">
    Labels inherited by all sub-calls for filtering and organization in debugging tools.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
    Custom key-value pairs for tracking additional context, inherited by all sub-calls.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="max_concurrency" type="number">
    Controls the maximum number of parallel calls when using [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch) or [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed).
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="callbacks" type="array">
    Handlers for monitoring and responding to events during execution.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="recursion_limit" type="number">
    Maximum recursion depth for chains to prevent infinite loops in complex pipelines.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  See full [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) reference for all supported attributes.
</Tip>

### Configurable models

You can also create a runtime-configurable model by specifying [`configurable_fields`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.configurable_fields). If you don't specify a model value, then `'model'` and `'model_provider'` will be configurable by default.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

configurable_model = init_chat_model(temperature=0)

configurable_model.invoke(
    "what's your name",
    config={"configurable": {"model": "gpt-5-nano"}},  # Run with GPT-5-Nano
)
configurable_model.invoke(
    "what's your name",
    config={"configurable": {"model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"}},  # Run with Claude
)
```

<Accordion title="Configurable model with default values">
  We can create a configurable model with default model values, specify which parameters are configurable, and add prefixes to configurable params:

  ```python  theme={null}
  first_model = init_chat_model(
          model="gpt-4.1-mini",
          temperature=0,
          configurable_fields=("model", "model_provider", "temperature", "max_tokens"),
          config_prefix="first",  # Useful when you have a chain with multiple models
  )

  first_model.invoke("what's your name")
  ```

  ```python  theme={null}
  first_model.invoke(
      "what's your name",
      config={
          "configurable": {
              "first_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
              "first_temperature": 0.5,
              "first_max_tokens": 100,
          }
      },
  )
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using a configurable model declaratively">
  We can call declarative operations like `bind_tools`, `with_structured_output`, `with_configurable`, etc. on a configurable model and chain a configurable model in the same way that we would a regularly instantiated chat model object.

  ```python  theme={null}
  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


  class GetWeather(BaseModel):
      """Get the current weather in a given location"""

          location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


  class GetPopulation(BaseModel):
      """Get the current population in a given location"""

          location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


  model = init_chat_model(temperature=0)
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([GetWeather, GetPopulation])

  model_with_tools.invoke(
      "what's bigger in 2024 LA or NYC", config={"configurable": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini"}}
  ).tool_calls
  ```

  ```
  [
      {
          'name': 'GetPopulation',
          'args': {'location': 'Los Angeles, CA'},
          'id': 'call_Ga9m8FAArIyEjItHmztPYA22',
          'type': 'tool_call'
      },
      {
          'name': 'GetPopulation',
          'args': {'location': 'New York, NY'},
          'id': 'call_jh2dEvBaAHRaw5JUDthOs7rt',
          'type': 'tool_call'
      }
  ]
  ```

  ```python  theme={null}
  model_with_tools.invoke(
      "what's bigger in 2024 LA or NYC",
          config={"configurable": {"model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"}},
  ).tool_calls
  ```

  ```
  [
      {
          'name': 'GetPopulation',
          'args': {'location': 'Los Angeles, CA'},
          'id': 'toolu_01JMufPf4F4t2zLj7miFeqXp',
          'type': 'tool_call'
      },
      {
          'name': 'GetPopulation',
          'args': {'location': 'New York City, NY'},
          'id': 'toolu_01RQBHcE8kEEbYTuuS8WqY1u',
          'type': 'tool_call'
      }

# Messages

Messages are the fundamental unit of context for models in LangChain. They represent the input and output of models, carrying both the content and metadata needed to represent the state of a conversation when interacting with an LLM.

Messages are objects that contain:

* <Icon icon="user" size={16} /> [**Role**](#message-types) - Identifies the message type (e.g. `system`, `user`)
* <Icon icon="folder-closed" size={16} /> [**Content**](#message-content) - Represents the actual content of the message (like text, images, audio, documents, etc.)
* <Icon icon="tag" size={16} /> [**Metadata**](#message-metadata) - Optional fields such as response information, message IDs, and token usage

LangChain provides a standard message type that works across all model providers, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the model being called.

## Basic usage

The simplest way to use messages is to create message objects and pass them to a model when [invoking](/oss/python/langchain/models#invocation).

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano")

system_msg = SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant.")
human_msg = HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")

# Use with chat models
messages = [system_msg, human_msg]
response = model.invoke(messages)  # Returns AIMessage
```

### Text prompts

Text prompts are strings - ideal for straightforward generation tasks where you don't need to retain conversation history.

```python  theme={null}
response = model.invoke("Write a haiku about spring")
```

**Use text prompts when:**

* You have a single, standalone request
* You don't need conversation history
* You want minimal code complexity

### Message prompts

Alternatively, you can pass in a list of messages to the model by providing a list of message objects.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage

messages = [
    SystemMessage("You are a poetry expert"),
    HumanMessage("Write a haiku about spring"),
    AIMessage("Cherry blossoms bloom...")
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

**Use message prompts when:**

* Managing multi-turn conversations
* Working with multimodal content (images, audio, files)
* Including system instructions

### Dictionary format

You can also specify messages directly in OpenAI chat completions format.

```python  theme={null}
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poetry expert"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about spring"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cherry blossoms bloom..."}
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

## Message types

* <Icon icon="gear" size={16} /> [System message](#system-message) - Tells the model how to behave and provide context for interactions
* <Icon icon="user" size={16} /> [Human message](#human-message) - Represents user input and interactions with the model
* <Icon icon="robot" size={16} /> [AI message](#ai-message) - Responses generated by the model, including text content, tool calls, and metadata
* <Icon icon="wrench" size={16} /> [Tool message](#tool-message) - Represents the outputs of [tool calls](/oss/python/langchain/models#tool-calling)

### System Message

A [`SystemMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.SystemMessage) represent an initial set of instructions that primes the model's behavior. You can use a system message to set the tone, define the model's role, and establish guidelines for responses.

```python Basic instructions theme={null}
system_msg = SystemMessage("You are a helpful coding assistant.")

messages = [
    system_msg,
    HumanMessage("How do I create a REST API?")
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

```python Detailed persona theme={null}
from langchain.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage

system_msg = SystemMessage("""
You are a senior Python developer with expertise in web frameworks.
Always provide code examples and explain your reasoning.
Be concise but thorough in your explanations.
""")

messages = [
    system_msg,
    HumanMessage("How do I create a REST API?")
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

***

### Human Message

A [`HumanMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.HumanMessage) represents user input and interactions. They can contain text, images, audio, files, and any other amount of multimodal [content](#message-content).

#### Text content

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Message object theme={null}
  response = model.invoke([
    HumanMessage("What is machine learning?")
  ])
  ```

  ```python String shortcut theme={null}
  # Using a string is a shortcut for a single HumanMessage
  response = model.invoke("What is machine learning?")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Message metadata

```python Add metadata theme={null}
human_msg = HumanMessage(
    content="Hello!",
    name="alice",  # Optional: identify different users
    id="msg_123",  # Optional: unique identifier for tracing
)
```

<Note>
  The `name` field behavior varies by provider - some use it for user identification, others ignore it. To check, refer to the model provider's [reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/).
</Note>

***

### AI Message

An [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) represents the output of a model invocation. They can include multimodal data, tool calls, and provider-specific metadata that you can later access.

```python  theme={null}
response = model.invoke("Explain AI")
print(type(response))  # <class 'langchain_core.messages.AIMessage'>
```

[`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) objects are returned by the model when calling it, which contains all of the associated metadata in the response.

Providers weigh/contextualize types of messages differently, which means it is sometimes helpful to manually create a new [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) object and insert it into the message history as if it came from the model.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import AIMessage, SystemMessage, HumanMessage

# Create an AI message manually (e.g., for conversation history)
ai_msg = AIMessage("I'd be happy to help you with that question!")

# Add to conversation history
messages = [
    SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant"),
    HumanMessage("Can you help me?"),
    ai_msg,  # Insert as if it came from the model
    HumanMessage("Great! What's 2+2?")
]

response = model.invoke(messages)
```

<Accordion title="Attributes">
  <ParamField path="text" type="string">
    The text content of the message.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="content" type="string | dict[]">
    The raw content of the message.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="content_blocks" type="ContentBlock[]">
    The standardized [content blocks](#message-content) of the message.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="tool_calls" type="dict[] | None">
    The tool calls made by the model. Empty if no tools are called.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="id" type="string">
    A unique identifier for the message (either automatically generated by LangChain or returned in the provider response)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="usage_metadata" type="dict | None">
    The usage metadata of the message, which can contain token counts when available.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="response_metadata" type="ResponseMetadata | None">
    The response metadata of the message.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

#### Tool calls

When models make [tool calls](/oss/python/langchain/models#tool-calling), they're included in the [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage):

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano")

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather at a location."""
    ...

model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])
response = model_with_tools.invoke("What's the weather in Paris?")

for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
    print(f"Tool: {tool_call['name']}")
    print(f"Args: {tool_call['args']}")
    print(f"ID: {tool_call['id']}")
```

Other structured data, such as reasoning or citations, can also appear in message [content](/oss/python/langchain/messages#message-content).

#### Token usage

An [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) can hold token counts and other usage metadata in its [`usage_metadata`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage.usage_metadata) field:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano")

response = model.invoke("Hello!")
response.usage_metadata
```

```
{'input_tokens': 8,
 'output_tokens': 304,
 'total_tokens': 312,
 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0},
 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 256}}
```

See [`UsageMetadata`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage.usage_metadata) for details.

#### Streaming and chunks

During streaming, you'll receive [`AIMessageChunk`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessageChunk) objects that can be combined into a full message object:

```python  theme={null}
chunks = []
full_message = None
for chunk in model.stream("Hi"):
    chunks.append(chunk)
    print(chunk.text)
    full_message = chunk if full_message is None else full_message + chunk
```

</Note>

***

### Tool Message

For models that support [tool calling](/oss/python/langchain/models#tool-calling), AI messages can contain tool calls. Tool messages are used to pass the results of a single tool execution back to the model.

[Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) can generate [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) objects directly. Below, we show a simple example. Read more in the [tools guide](/oss/python/langchain/tools).

```python  theme={null}
# After a model makes a tool call
ai_message = AIMessage(
    content=[],
    tool_calls=[{
        "name": "get_weather",
        "args": {"location": "San Francisco"},
        "id": "call_123"
    }]
)

# Execute tool and create result message
weather_result = "Sunny, 72°F"
tool_message = ToolMessage(
    content=weather_result,
    tool_call_id="call_123"  # Must match the call ID
)

# Continue conversation
messages = [
    HumanMessage("What's the weather in San Francisco?"),
    ai_message,  # Model's tool call
    tool_message,  # Tool execution result
]
response = model.invoke(messages)  # Model processes the result
```

<Accordion title="Attributes">
  <ParamField path="content" type="string" required>
    The stringified output of the tool call.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="tool_call_id" type="string" required>
    The ID of the tool call that this message is responding to. (this must match the ID of the tool call in the [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage))
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
    The name of the tool that was called.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="artifact" type="dict">
    Additional data not sent to the model but can be accessed programmatically.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

<Note>
  The `artifact` field stores supplementary data that won't be sent to the model but can be accessed programmatically. This is useful for storing raw results, debugging information, or data for downstream processing without cluttering the model's context.

  <Accordion title="Example: Using artifact for retrieval metadata">
    For example, a [retrieval](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) tool could retrieve a passage from a document for reference by a model. Where message `content` contains text that the model will reference, an `artifact` can contain document identifiers or other metadata that an application can use (e.g., to render a page). See example below:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.messages import ToolMessage

    # Sent to model
    message_content = "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."

    # Artifact available downstream
    artifact = {"document_id": "doc_123", "page": 0}

    tool_message = ToolMessage(
        content=message_content,
        tool_call_id="call_123",
        name="search_books",
        artifact=artifact,
    )
    ```

    See the [RAG tutorial](/oss/python/langchain/rag) for an end-to-end example of building retrieval [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) with LangChain.
  </Accordion>
</Note>

## Message content

You can think of a message's content as the payload of data that gets sent to the model. Messages have a `content` attribute that is loosely-typed, supporting strings and lists of untyped objects (e.g., dictionaries). This allows support for provider-native structures directly in LangChain chat models, such as [multimodal](#multimodal) content and other data.

Separately, LangChain provides dedicated content types for text, reasoning, citations, multi-modal data, server-side tool calls, and other message content. See [content blocks](#standard-content-blocks) below.

LangChain chat models accept message content in the `content` attribute, and can contain:

1. A string
2. A list of content blocks in a provider-native format
3. A list of [LangChain's standard content blocks](#standard-content-blocks)

See below for an example using [multimodal](#multimodal) inputs:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage

# String content
human_message = HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")

# Provider-native format (e.g., OpenAI)
human_message = HumanMessage(content=[
    {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}}
])

# List of standard content blocks
human_message = HumanMessage(content_blocks=[
    {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"type": "image", "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"},
])
```

<Tip>
  Specifying `content_blocks` when initializing a message will still populate message
  `content`, but provides a type-safe interface for doing so.
</Tip>

### Standard content blocks

LangChain provides a standard representation for message content that works across providers.

Message objects implement a `content_blocks` property that will lazily parse the `content` attribute into a standard, type-safe representation. For example, messages generated from [ChatAnthropic](/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic) or [ChatOpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai) will include `thinking` or `reasoning` blocks in the format of the respective provider, but can be lazily parsed into a consistent [`ReasoningContentBlock`](#content-block-reference) representation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Anthropic">
    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.messages import AIMessage

    message = AIMessage(
        content=[
            {"type": "thinking", "thinking": "...", "signature": "WaUjzkyp..."},
            {"type": "text", "text": "..."},
        ],
        response_metadata={"model_provider": "anthropic"}

See the [integrations guides](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) to get started with the
inference provider of your choice.

<Note>
  **Serializing standard content**

  If an application outside of LangChain needs access to the standard content block
  representation, you can opt-in to storing content blocks in message content.

  To do this, you can set the `LC_OUTPUT_VERSION` environment variable to `v1`. Or,
  initialize any chat model with `output_version="v1"`:

  ```python  theme={null}
  from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

  model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano", output_version="v1")
  ```
</Note>

### Multimodal

**Multimodality** refers to the ability to work with data that comes in different
forms, such as text, audio, images, and video. LangChain includes standard types
for these data that can be used across providers.

[Chat models](/oss/python/langchain/models) can accept multimodal data as input and generate
it as output. Below we show short examples of input messages featuring multimodal data.

<Note>
  Extra keys can be included top-level in the content block or nested in `"extras": {"key": value}`.

  [OpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai#pdfs) and [AWS Bedrock Converse](/oss/python/integrations/chat/bedrock),
  for example, require a filename for PDFs. See the [provider page](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview)
  for your chosen model for specifics.

<Info>
  Content blocks were introduced as a new property on messages in LangChain v1 to standardize content formats across providers while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. Content blocks are not a replacement for the [`content`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.messages.BaseMessage.content) property, but rather a new property that can be used to access the content of a message in a standardized format.
</Info>

## Use with chat models

[Chat models](/oss/python/langchain/models) accept a sequence of message objects as input and return an [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) as output. Interactions are often stateless, so that a simple conversational loop involves invoking a model with a growing list of messages.

Refer to the below guides to learn more:

* Built-in features for [persisting and managing conversation histories](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory)
* Strategies for managing context windows, including [trimming and summarizing messages](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory#common-patterns)

# Messages

Messages are the fundamental unit of context for models in LangChain. They represent the input and output of models, carrying both the content and metadata needed to represent the state of a conversation when interacting with an LLM.

Messages are objects that contain:

* <Icon icon="user" size={16} /> [**Role**](#message-types) - Identifies the message type (e.g. `system`, `user`)
* <Icon icon="folder-closed" size={16} /> [**Content**](#message-content) - Represents the actual content of the message (like text, images, audio, documents, etc.)
* <Icon icon="tag" size={16} /> [**Metadata**](#message-metadata) - Optional fields such as response information, message IDs, and token usage

LangChain provides a standard message type that works across all model providers, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the model being called.

## Basic usage

The simplest way to use messages is to create message objects and pass them to a model when [invoking](/oss/python/langchain/models#invocation).

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano")

system_msg = SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant.")
human_msg = HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")

# Use with chat models
messages = [system_msg, human_msg]
response = model.invoke(messages)  # Returns AIMessage
```

### Text prompts

Text prompts are strings - ideal for straightforward generation tasks where you don't need to retain conversation history.

```python  theme={null}
response = model.invoke("Write a haiku about spring")
```

**Use text prompts when:**

* You have a single, standalone request
* You don't need conversation history
* You want minimal code complexity

### Message prompts

Alternatively, you can pass in a list of messages to the model by providing a list of message objects.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage

messages = [
    SystemMessage("You are a poetry expert"),
    HumanMessage("Write a haiku about spring"),
    AIMessage("Cherry blossoms bloom...")
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

**Use message prompts when:**

* Managing multi-turn conversations
* Working with multimodal content (images, audio, files)
* Including system instructions

### Dictionary format

You can also specify messages directly in OpenAI chat completions format.

```python  theme={null}
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poetry expert"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about spring"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cherry blossoms bloom..."}
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

## Message types

* <Icon icon="gear" size={16} /> [System message](#system-message) - Tells the model how to behave and provide context for interactions
* <Icon icon="user" size={16} /> [Human message](#human-message) - Represents user input and interactions with the model
* <Icon icon="robot" size={16} /> [AI message](#ai-message) - Responses generated by the model, including text content, tool calls, and metadata
* <Icon icon="wrench" size={16} /> [Tool message](#tool-message) - Represents the outputs of [tool calls](/oss/python/langchain/models#tool-calling)

### System Message

A [`SystemMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.SystemMessage) represent an initial set of instructions that primes the model's behavior. You can use a system message to set the tone, define the model's role, and establish guidelines for responses.

```python Basic instructions theme={null}
system_msg = SystemMessage("You are a helpful coding assistant.")

messages = [
    system_msg,
    HumanMessage("How do I create a REST API?")
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

```python Detailed persona theme={null}
from langchain.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage

system_msg = SystemMessage("""
You are a senior Python developer with expertise in web frameworks.
Always provide code examples and explain your reasoning.
Be concise but thorough in your explanations.
""")

messages = [
    system_msg,
    HumanMessage("How do I create a REST API?")
]
response = model.invoke(messages)
```

***

### Human Message

A [`HumanMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.HumanMessage) represents user input and interactions. They can contain text, images, audio, files, and any other amount of multimodal [content](#message-content).

#### Text content

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Message object theme={null}
  response = model.invoke([
    HumanMessage("What is machine learning?")
  ])
  ```

  ```python String shortcut theme={null}
  # Using a string is a shortcut for a single HumanMessage
  response = model.invoke("What is machine learning?")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Message metadata

```python Add metadata theme={null}
human_msg = HumanMessage(
    content="Hello!",
    name="alice",  # Optional: identify different users
    id="msg_123",  # Optional: unique identifier for tracing
)
```

<Note>
  The `name` field behavior varies by provider - some use it for user identification, others ignore it. To check, refer to the model provider's [reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/).
</Note>

***

### AI Message

An [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) represents the output of a model invocation. They can include multimodal data, tool calls, and provider-specific metadata that you can later access.

```python  theme={null}
response = model.invoke("Explain AI")
print(type(response))  # <class 'langchain_core.messages.AIMessage'>
```

[`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) objects are returned by the model when calling it, which contains all of the associated metadata in the response.

Providers weigh/contextualize types of messages differently, which means it is sometimes helpful to manually create a new [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) object and insert it into the message history as if it came from the model.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import AIMessage, SystemMessage, HumanMessage

# Create an AI message manually (e.g., for conversation history)
ai_msg = AIMessage("I'd be happy to help you with that question!")

# Add to conversation history
messages = [
    SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant"),
    HumanMessage("Can you help me?"),
    ai_msg,  # Insert as if it came from the model
    HumanMessage("Great! What's 2+2?")
]

response = model.invoke(messages)
```

<Accordion title="Attributes">
  <ParamField path="text" type="string">
    The text content of the message.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="content" type="string | dict[]">
    The raw content of the message.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="content_blocks" type="ContentBlock[]">
    The standardized [content blocks](#message-content) of the message.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="tool_calls" type="dict[] | None">
    The tool calls made by the model. Empty if no tools are called.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="id" type="string">
    A unique identifier for the message (either automatically generated by LangChain or returned in the provider response)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="usage_metadata" type="dict | None">
    The usage metadata of the message, which can contain token counts when available.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="response_metadata" type="ResponseMetadata | None">
    The response metadata of the message.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

#### Tool calls

When models make [tool calls](/oss/python/langchain/models#tool-calling), they're included in the [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage):

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano")

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather at a location."""
    ...

model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])
response = model_with_tools.invoke("What's the weather in Paris?")

for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
    print(f"Tool: {tool_call['name']}")
    print(f"Args: {tool_call['args']}")
    print(f"ID: {tool_call['id']}")
```

Other structured data, such as reasoning or citations, can also appear in message [content](/oss/python/langchain/messages#message-content).

#### Token usage

An [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) can hold token counts and other usage metadata in its [`usage_metadata`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage.usage_metadata) field:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano")

response = model.invoke("Hello!")
response.usage_metadata
```

```
{'input_tokens': 8,
 'output_tokens': 304,
 'total_tokens': 312,
 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0},
 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 256}}
```

See [`UsageMetadata`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage.usage_metadata) for details.

#### Streaming and chunks

During streaming, you'll receive [`AIMessageChunk`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessageChunk) objects that can be combined into a full message object:

```python  theme={null}
chunks = []
full_message = None
for chunk in model.stream("Hi"):
    chunks.append(chunk)
    print(chunk.text)
    full_message = chunk if full_message is None else full_message + chunk
```

### Tool Message

For models that support [tool calling](/oss/python/langchain/models#tool-calling), AI messages can contain tool calls. Tool messages are used to pass the results of a single tool execution back to the model.

[Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) can generate [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) objects directly. Below, we show a simple example. Read more in the [tools guide](/oss/python/langchain/tools).

```python  theme={null}
# After a model makes a tool call
ai_message = AIMessage(
    content=[],
    tool_calls=[{
        "name": "get_weather",
        "args": {"location": "San Francisco"},
        "id": "call_123"
    }]
)

# Execute tool and create result message
weather_result = "Sunny, 72°F"
tool_message = ToolMessage(
    content=weather_result,
    tool_call_id="call_123"  # Must match the call ID
)

# Continue conversation
messages = [
    HumanMessage("What's the weather in San Francisco?"),
    ai_message,  # Model's tool call
    tool_message,  # Tool execution result
]
response = model.invoke(messages)  # Model processes the result
```

<Accordion title="Attributes">
  <ParamField path="content" type="string" required>
    The stringified output of the tool call.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="tool_call_id" type="string" required>
    The ID of the tool call that this message is responding to. (this must match the ID of the tool call in the [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage))
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
    The name of the tool that was called.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="artifact" type="dict">
    Additional data not sent to the model but can be accessed programmatically.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

<Note>
  The `artifact` field stores supplementary data that won't be sent to the model but can be accessed programmatically. This is useful for storing raw results, debugging information, or data for downstream processing without cluttering the model's context.

  <Accordion title="Example: Using artifact for retrieval metadata">
    For example, a [retrieval](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) tool could retrieve a passage from a document for reference by a model. Where message `content` contains text that the model will reference, an `artifact` can contain document identifiers or other metadata that an application can use (e.g., to render a page). See example below:

    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.messages import ToolMessage

    # Sent to model
    message_content = "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."

    # Artifact available downstream
    artifact = {"document_id": "doc_123", "page": 0}

    tool_message = ToolMessage(
        content=message_content,
        tool_call_id="call_123",
        name="search_books",
        artifact=artifact,
    )
    ```

    See the [RAG tutorial](/oss/python/langchain/rag) for an end-to-end example of building retrieval [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) with LangChain.
  </Accordion>
</Note>

## Message content

You can think of a message's content as the payload of data that gets sent to the model. Messages have a `content` attribute that is loosely-typed, supporting strings and lists of untyped objects (e.g., dictionaries). This allows support for provider-native structures directly in LangChain chat models, such as [multimodal](#multimodal) content and other data.

Separately, LangChain provides dedicated content types for text, reasoning, citations, multi-modal data, server-side tool calls, and other message content. See [content blocks](#standard-content-blocks) below.

LangChain chat models accept message content in the `content` attribute, and can contain:

1. A string
2. A list of content blocks in a provider-native format
3. A list of [LangChain's standard content blocks](#standard-content-blocks)

See below for an example using [multimodal](#multimodal) inputs:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage

# String content
human_message = HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")

# Provider-native format (e.g., OpenAI)
human_message = HumanMessage(content=[
    {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}}
])

# List of standard content blocks
human_message = HumanMessage(content_blocks=[
    {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"type": "image", "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"},
])
```

<Tip>
  Specifying `content_blocks` when initializing a message will still populate message
  `content`, but provides a type-safe interface for doing so.
</Tip>

### Standard content blocks

LangChain provides a standard representation for message content that works across providers.

Message objects implement a `content_blocks` property that will lazily parse the `content` attribute into a standard, type-safe representation. For example, messages generated from [ChatAnthropic](/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic) or [ChatOpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai) will include `thinking` or `reasoning` blocks in the format of the respective provider, but can be lazily parsed into a consistent [`ReasoningContentBlock`](#content-block-reference) representation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Anthropic">
    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.messages import AIMessage

    message = AIMessage(
        content=[
            {"type": "thinking", "thinking": "...", "signature": "WaUjzkyp..."},
            {"type": "text", "text": "..."},
        ],
        response_metadata={"model_provider": "anthropic"}
    )
    message.content_blocks
    ```

    ```
    [{'type': 'reasoning',
      'reasoning': '...',
      'extras': {'signature': 'WaUjzkyp...'}},
     {'type': 'text', 'text': '...'}]
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OpenAI">
    ```python  theme={null}
    from langchain.messages import AIMessage

    message = AIMessage(
        content=[
            {
                "type": "reasoning",
                "id": "rs_abc123",
                "summary": [
                    {"type": "summary_text", "text": "summary 1"},
                    {"type": "summary_text", "text": "summary 2"},
                ],
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "...", "id": "msg_abc123"},
        ],
        response_metadata={"model_provider": "openai"}
    )
    message.content_blocks
    ```

    ```
    [{'type': 'reasoning', 'id': 'rs_abc123', 'reasoning': 'summary 1'},
     {'type': 'reasoning', 'id': 'rs_abc123', 'reasoning': 'summary 2'},
     {'type': 'text', 'text': '...', 'id': 'msg_abc123'}]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

See the [integrations guides](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) to get started with the
inference provider of your choice.

<Note>
  **Serializing standard content**

  If an application outside of LangChain needs access to the standard content block
  representation, you can opt-in to storing content blocks in message content.

  To do this, you can set the `LC_OUTPUT_VERSION` environment variable to `v1`. Or,
  initialize any chat model with `output_version="v1"`:

  ```python  theme={null}
  from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

  model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5-nano", output_version="v1")
  ```
</Note>

### Multimodal

**Multimodality** refers to the ability to work with data that comes in different
forms, such as text, audio, images, and video. LangChain includes standard types
for these data that can be used across providers.

[Chat models](/oss/python/langchain/models) can accept multimodal data as input and generate
it as output. Below we show short examples of input messages featuring multimodal data.

<Note>
  Extra keys can be included top-level in the content block or nested in `"extras": {"key": value}`.

  [OpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai#pdfs) and [AWS Bedrock Converse](/oss/python/integrations/chat/bedrock),
  for example, require a filename for PDFs. See the [provider page](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview)
  for your chosen model for specifics.

<Info>
  Content blocks were introduced as a new property on messages in LangChain v1 to standardize content formats across providers while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. Content blocks are not a replacement for the [`content`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.messages.BaseMessage.content) property, but rather a new property that can be used to access the content of a message in a standardized format.
</Info>

## Use with chat models

[Chat models](/oss/python/langchain/models) accept a sequence of message objects as input and return an [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) as output. Interactions are often stateless, so that a simple conversational loop involves invoking a model with a growing list of messages.

Refer to the below guides to learn more:

* Built-in features for [persisting and managing conversation histories](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory)
* Strategies for managing context windows, including [trimming and summarizing messages](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory#common-patterns)

# Short-term memory

## Overview

Memory is a system that remembers information about previous interactions. For AI agents, memory is crucial because it lets them remember previous interactions, learn from feedback, and adapt to user preferences. As agents tackle more complex tasks with numerous user interactions, this capability becomes essential for both efficiency and user satisfaction.

Short term memory lets your application remember previous interactions within a single thread or conversation.

<Note>
  A thread organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation.
</Note>

Conversation history is the most common form of short-term memory. Long conversations pose a challenge to today's LLMs; a full history may not fit inside an LLM's context window, resulting in an context loss or errors.

Even if your model supports the full context length, most LLMs still perform poorly over long contexts. They get "distracted" by stale or off-topic content, all while suffering from slower response times and higher costs.

Chat models accept context using [messages](/oss/python/langchain/messages), which include instructions (a system message) and inputs (human messages). In chat applications, messages alternate between human inputs and model responses, resulting in a list of messages that grows longer over time. Because context windows are limited, many applications can benefit from using techniques to remove or "forget" stale information.

## Usage

To add short-term memory (thread-level persistence) to an agent, you need to specify a `checkpointer` when creating an agent.

<Info>
  LangChain's agent manages short-term memory as a part of your agent's state.

  By storing these in the graph's state, the agent can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.

  State is persisted to a database (or memory) using a checkpointer so the thread can be resumed at any time.

  Short-term memory updates when the agent is invoked or a step (like a tool call) is completed, and the state is read at the start of each step.
</Info>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver  # [!code highlight]


agent = create_agent(
    "openai:gpt-5",
    [get_user_info],
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),  # [!code highlight]
)

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi! My name is Bob."}]},
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}},  # [!code highlight]
)
```

### In production

In production, use a checkpointer backed by a database:

```shell  theme={null}
pip install langgraph-checkpoint-postgres
```

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent

from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver  # [!code highlight]


DB_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5442/postgres?sslmode=disable"
with PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:
    checkpointer.setup() # auto create tables in PostgresSql
    agent = create_agent(
        "openai:gpt-5",
        [get_user_info],
        checkpointer=checkpointer,  # [!code highlight]
    )
```

## Customizing agent memory

By default, agents use [`AgentState`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.AgentState) to manage short term memory, specifically the conversation history via a `messages` key.

You can extend [`AgentState`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.AgentState) to add additional fields. Custom state schemas are passed to [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) using the [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) parameter.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent, AgentState
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver


class CustomAgentState(AgentState):  # [!code highlight]
    user_id: str  # [!code highlight]
    preferences: dict  # [!code highlight]

agent = create_agent(
    "openai:gpt-5",
    [get_user_info],
    state_schema=CustomAgentState,  # [!code highlight]
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)

# Custom state can be passed in invoke
result = agent.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
        "user_id": "user_123",  # [!code highlight]
        "preferences": {"theme": "dark"}  # [!code highlight]
    },
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}})
```

## Common patterns

With [short-term memory](#add-short-term-memory) enabled, long conversations can exceed the LLM's context window. Common solutions are:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trim messages" icon="scissors" href="#trim-messages" arrow>
    Remove first or last N messages (before calling LLM)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delete messages" icon="trash" href="#delete-messages" arrow>
    Delete messages from LangGraph state permanently
  </Card>

  <Card title="Summarize messages" icon="layer-group" href="#summarize-messages" arrow>
    Summarize earlier messages in the history and replace them with a summary
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom strategies" icon="gears">
    Custom strategies (e.g., message filtering, etc.)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This allows the agent to keep track of the conversation without exceeding the LLM's context window.

### Trim messages

Most LLMs have a maximum supported context window (denominated in tokens).

One way to decide when to truncate messages is to count the tokens in the message history and truncate whenever it approaches that limit. If you're using LangChain, you can use the trim messages utility and specify the number of tokens to keep from the list, as well as the `strategy` (e.g., keep the last `max_tokens`) to use for handling the boundary.

To trim message history in an agent, use the [`@before_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.before_model) middleware decorator:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langchain.agents import create_agent, AgentState
from langchain.agents.middleware import before_model
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from typing import Any


@before_model
def trim_messages(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Keep only the last few messages to fit context window."""
    messages = state["messages"]

    if len(messages) <= 3:
        return None  # No changes needed

    first_msg = messages[0]
    recent_messages = messages[-3:] if len(messages) % 2 == 0 else messages[-4:]
    new_messages = [first_msg] + recent_messages

    return {
        "messages": [
            RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES),
            *new_messages
        ]
    }

agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    middleware=[trim_messages],
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)

config: RunnableConfig = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

agent.invoke({"messages": "hi, my name is bob"}, config)
agent.invoke({"messages": "write a short poem about cats"}, config)
agent.invoke({"messages": "now do the same but for dogs"}, config)
final_response = agent.invoke({"messages": "what's my name?"}, config)

final_response["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
"""
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Your name is Bob. You told me that earlier.
If you'd like me to call you a nickname or use a different name, just say the word.
"""
```

### Delete messages

You can delete messages from the graph state to manage the message history.

This is useful when you want to remove specific messages or clear the entire message history.

To delete messages from the graph state, you can use the `RemoveMessage`.

For `RemoveMessage` to work, you need to use a state key with [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages) [reducer](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#reducers).

The default [`AgentState`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.AgentState) provides this.

To remove specific messages:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import RemoveMessage  # [!code highlight]

def delete_messages(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    if len(messages) > 2:
        # remove the earliest two messages
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:2]]}  # [!code highlight]
```

To remove **all** messages:

```python  theme={null}
from langgraph.graph.message import REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES  # [!code highlight]

def delete_messages(state):
    return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)]}  # [!code highlight]
```

<Warning>
  When deleting messages, **make sure** that the resulting message history is valid. Check the limitations of the LLM provider you're using. For example:

  * Some providers expect message history to start with a `user` message
  * Most providers require `assistant` messages with tool calls to be followed by corresponding `tool` result messages.
</Warning>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import RemoveMessage
from langchain.agents import create_agent, AgentState
from langchain.agents.middleware import after_model
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig


@after_model
def delete_old_messages(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict | None:
    """Remove old messages to keep conversation manageable."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    if len(messages) > 2:
        # remove the earliest two messages
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:2]]}
    return None


agent = create_agent(
    "openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[],
    system_prompt="Please be concise and to the point.",
    middleware=[delete_old_messages],
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)

config: RunnableConfig = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi! I'm bob"}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])

for event in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])
```

```
[('human', "hi! I'm bob")]
[('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', 'Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? I can answer questions, brainstorm ideas, draft text, explain things, or help with code.')]
[('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', 'Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? I can answer questions, brainstorm ideas, draft text, explain things, or help with code.'), ('human', "what's my name?")]
[('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', 'Hi Bob! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? I can answer questions, brainstorm ideas, draft text, explain things, or help with code.'), ('human', "what's my name?"), ('ai', 'Your name is Bob. How can I help you today, Bob?')]
[('human', "what's my name?"), ('ai', 'Your name is Bob. How can I help you today, Bob?')]
```

### Summarize messages

The problem with trimming or removing messages, as shown above, is that you may lose information from culling of the message queue.
Because of this, some applications benefit from a more sophisticated approach of summarizing the message history using a chat model.

## Access memory

You can access and modify the short-term memory (state) of an agent in several ways:

### Tools

#### Read short-term memory in a tool

Access short term memory (state) in a tool using the `ToolRuntime` parameter.

The `tool_runtime` parameter is hidden from the tool signature (so the model doesn't see it), but the tool can access the state through it.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent, AgentState
from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime


class CustomState(AgentState):
    user_id: str

@tool
def get_user_info(
    runtime: ToolRuntime
) -> str:
    """Look up user info."""
    user_id = runtime.state["user_id"]
    return "User is John Smith" if user_id == "user_123" else "Unknown user"

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[get_user_info],
    state_schema=CustomState,
)

result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": "look up user information",
    "user_id": "user_123"
})
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
# > User is John Smith.
```

#### Write short-term memory from tools

To modify the agent's short-term memory (state) during execution, you can return state updates directly from the tools.

This is useful for persisting intermediate results or making information accessible to subsequent tools or prompts.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain.agents import create_agent, AgentState
from langgraph.types import Command
from pydantic import BaseModel


class CustomState(AgentState):  # [!code highlight]
    user_name: str

class CustomContext(BaseModel):
    user_id: str

@tool
def update_user_info(
    runtime: ToolRuntime[CustomContext, CustomState],
) -> Command:
    """Look up and update user info."""
    user_id = runtime.context.user_id  # [!code highlight]
    name = "John Smith" if user_id == "user_123" else "Unknown user"
    return Command(update={
        "user_name": name,
        # update the message history
        "messages": [
            ToolMessage(
                "Successfully looked up user information",
                tool_call_id=runtime.tool_call_id
            )
        ]
    })

@tool
def greet(
    runtime: ToolRuntime[CustomContext, CustomState]
) -> str:
    """Use this to greet the user once you found their info."""
    user_name = runtime.state["user_name"]
    return f"Hello {user_name}!"
  # [!code highlight]
agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[update_user_info, greet],
    state_schema=CustomState,
    context_schema=CustomContext,  # [!code highlight]
)

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "greet the user"}]},
    context=CustomContext(user_id="user_123"),
)
```

### Prompt

Access short term memory (state) in middleware to create dynamic prompts based on conversation history or custom state fields.

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import AnyMessage
from langchain.agents import create_agent, AgentState
from typing import TypedDict


class CustomContext(TypedDict):
    user_name: str


from langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather in a city."""
    return f"The weather in {city} is always sunny!"


@dynamic_prompt
def dynamic_system_prompt(request: ModelRequest) -> str:
    user_name = request.runtime.context["user_name"]
    system_prompt = f"You are a helpful assistant. Address the user as {user_name}."
    return system_prompt


agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[get_weather],
    middleware=[dynamic_system_prompt],
    context_schema=CustomContext,
)

result = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in SF?"}]},
    context=CustomContext(user_name="John Smith"),
)
for msg in result["messages"]:
    msg.pretty_print()
```

```shell title="Output" theme={null}
================================ Human Message =================================

What is the weather in SF?
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_WFQlOGn4b2yoJrv7cih342FG)
 Call ID: call_WFQlOGn4b2yoJrv7cih342FG
  Args:
    city: San Francisco
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: get_weather

The weather in San Francisco is always sunny!
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hi John Smith, the weather in San Francisco is always sunny!
```

### Before model

Access short term memory (state) in [`@before_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.before_model) middleware to process messages before model calls.

```mermaid  theme={null}
%%{
    init: {
        "fontFamily": "monospace",
        "flowchart": {
        "curve": "basis"

@before_model
def trim_messages(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Keep only the last few messages to fit context window."""
    messages = state["messages"]

    if len(messages) <= 3:
        return None  # No changes needed

    first_msg = messages[0]
    recent_messages = messages[-3:] if len(messages) % 2 == 0 else messages[-4:]
    new_messages = [first_msg] + recent_messages

    return {
        "messages": [
            RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES),
            *new_messages
        ]
    }

agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    middleware=[trim_messages]
)

config: RunnableConfig = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

agent.invoke({"messages": "hi, my name is bob"}, config)
agent.invoke({"messages": "write a short poem about cats"}, config)
agent.invoke({"messages": "now do the same but for dogs"}, config)
final_response = agent.invoke({"messages": "what's my name?"}, config)

final_response["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
"""
================================== Ai Message ==================================

If you'd like me to call you a nickname or use a different name, just say the word.
"""
```

### After model

Access short term memory (state) in [`@after_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.after_model) middleware to process messages after model calls.

```mermaid  theme={null}
%%{
    init: {
        "fontFamily": "monospace",
        "flowchart": {
        "curve": "basis"

        "themeVariables": {"edgeLabelBackground": "transparent"}
    }
}%%

```

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.messages import RemoveMessage

@after_model
def validate_response(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict | None:
    """Remove messages containing sensitive words."""
    STOP_WORDS = ["password", "secret"]
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if any(word in last_message.content for word in STOP_WORDS):
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=last_message.id)]}
    return None

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[],
    middleware=[validate_response],
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
)
```

# Streaming

LangChain implements a streaming system to surface real-time updates.

Streaming is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.

## Overview

LangChain's streaming system lets you surface live feedback from agent runs to your application.

What's possible with LangChain streaming:

* <Icon icon="brain" size={16} /> [**Stream agent progress**](#agent-progress) — get state updates after each agent step.
* <Icon icon="square-binary" size={16} /> [**Stream LLM tokens**](#llm-tokens) — stream language model tokens as they're generated.
* <Icon icon="table" size={16} /> [**Stream custom updates**](#custom-updates) — emit user-defined signals (e.g., `"Fetched 10/100 records"`).
* <Icon icon="layer-plus" size={16} /> [**Stream multiple modes**](#stream-multiple-modes) — choose from `updates` (agent progress), `messages` (LLM tokens + metadata), or `custom` (arbitrary user data).

## Agent progress

To stream agent progress, use the [`stream`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.stream) or [`astream`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.astream) methods with `stream_mode="updates"`. This emits an event after every agent step.

For example, if you have an agent that calls a tool once, you should see the following updates:

* **LLM node**: [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) with tool call requests
* **Tool node**: [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) with execution result
* **LLM node**: Final AI response

```python title="Streaming agent progress" theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent


def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""

    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[get_weather],
)
for chunk in agent.stream(  # [!code highlight]
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in SF?"}]},
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    for step, data in chunk.items():
        print(f"step: {step}")
        print(f"content: {data['messages'][-1].content_blocks}")
```

```shell title="Output" theme={null}
step: model
content: [{'type': 'tool_call', 'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'city': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_OW2NYNsNSKhRZpjW0wm2Aszd'}]

step: tools
content: [{'type': 'text', 'text': "It's always sunny in San Francisco!"}]

step: model
content: [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'It's always sunny in San Francisco!'}]
```

## LLM tokens

To stream tokens as they are produced by the LLM, use `stream_mode="messages"`. Below you can see the output of the agent streaming tool calls and the final response.

```python title="Streaming LLM tokens" theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent


def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""

    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[get_weather],
)
for token, metadata in agent.stream(  # [!code highlight]
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in SF?"}]},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    print(f"node: {metadata['langgraph_node']}")
    print(f"content: {token.content_blocks}")
    print("\n")
```

```shell title="Output" expandable theme={null}
node: model
content: [{'type': 'tool_call_chunk', 'id': 'call_vbCyBcP8VuneUzyYlSBZZsVa', 'name': 'get_weather', 'args': '', 'index': 0}]


node: model
content: [{'type': 'tool_call_chunk', 'id': None, 'name': None, 'args': '{"', 'index': 0}]


node: model
content: [{'type': 'tool_call_chunk', 'id': None, 'name': None, 'args': 'city', 'index': 0}]


node: model

node: model
content: [{'type': 'tool_call_chunk', 'id': None, 'name': None, 'args': ' Francisco', 'index': 0}]


node: model
content: [{'type': 'tool_call_chunk', 'id': None, 'name': None, 'args': '"}', 'index': 0}]


node: model
content: []


node: tools
content: [{'type': 'text', 'text': "It's always sunny in San Francisco!"}]


node: model

node: model
content: [{'type': 'text', 'text': ' Francisco'}]


node: model
content: [{'type': 'text', 'text': '!"\n\n'}]
```

## Custom updates

To stream updates from tools as they are executed, you can use [`get_stream_writer`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/config/#langgraph.config.get_stream_writer).

```python title="Streaming custom updates" theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langgraph.config import get_stream_writer  # [!code highlight]


def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    writer = get_stream_writer()  # [!code highlight]
    # stream any arbitrary data
    writer(f"Looking up data for city: {city}")
    writer(f"Acquired data for city: {city}")
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

for chunk in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in SF?"}]},
    stream_mode="custom"  # [!code highlight]
):
    print(chunk)
```

```shell title="Output" theme={null}
Looking up data for city: San Francisco
Acquired data for city: San Francisco
```

<Note>
  If you add [`get_stream_writer`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/config/#langgraph.config.get_stream_writer) inside your tool, you won't be able to invoke the tool outside of a LangGraph execution context.
</Note>

## Stream multiple modes

You can specify multiple streaming modes by passing stream mode as a list: `stream_mode=["updates", "custom"]`:

```python title="Streaming multiple modes" theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langgraph.config import get_stream_writer


def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    writer = get_stream_writer()
    writer(f"Looking up data for city: {city}")
    writer(f"Acquired data for city: {city}")
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

for stream_mode, chunk in agent.stream(  # [!code highlight]
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in SF?"}]},
    stream_mode=["updates", "custom"]
):
    print(f"stream_mode: {stream_mode}")
    print(f"content: {chunk}")
    print("\n")
```

```shell title="Output" theme={null}
stream_mode: updates
content: {'model': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 280, 'prompt_tokens': 132, 'total_tokens': 412, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 256, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-C9tlgBzGEbedGYxZ0rTCz5F7OXpL7', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--480c07cb-e405-4411-aa7f-0520fddeed66-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'city': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_KTNQIftMrl9vgNwEfAJMVu7r', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 132, 'output_tokens': 280, 'total_tokens': 412, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 256}})]}}


stream_mode: custom
content: Looking up data for city: San Francisco


stream_mode: custom
content: Acquired data for city: San Francisco


stream_mode: updates
content: {'tools': {'messages': [ToolMessage(content="It's always sunny in San Francisco!", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='call_KTNQIftMrl9vgNwEfAJMVu7r')]}}


stream_mode: updates
content: {'model': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='San Francisco weather: It's always sunny in San Francisco!\n\n', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 764, 'prompt_tokens': 168, 'total_tokens': 932, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 704, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-C9tljDFVki1e1haCyikBptAuXuHYG', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--acbc740a-18fe-4a14-8619-da92a0d0ee90-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 168, 'output_tokens': 764, 'total_tokens': 932, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 704}})]}}
```

## Disable streaming

In some applications you might need to disable streaming of individual tokens for a given model.

This is useful in [multi-agent](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) systems to control which agents stream their output.

See the [Models](/oss/python/langchain/models#disable-streaming) guide to learn how to disable streaming.

# Middleware

> Control and customize agent execution at every step

Middleware provides a way to more tightly control what happens inside the agent.

The core agent loop involves calling a model, letting it choose tools to execute, and then finishing when it calls no more tools:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=ac72e48317a9ced68fd1be64e89ec063" alt="Core agent loop diagram" className="rounded-lg" data-og-width="300" width="300" data-og-height="268" height="268" data-path="oss/images/core_agent_loop.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=a4c4b766b6678ef52a6ed556b1a0b032 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=111869e6e99a52c0eff60a1ef7ddc49c 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=6c1e21de7b53bd0a29683aca09c6f86e 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=88bef556edba9869b759551c610c60f4 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=9b0bdd138e9548eeb5056dc0ed2d4a4b 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl/oss/images/core_agent_loop.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Tazq8zGc0yYUYrDl&q=85&s=41eb4f053ed5e6b0ba5bad2badf6d755 2500w" />
</div>

Middleware exposes hooks before and after each of those steps:

Add middleware by passing it to [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent):

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import SummarizationMiddleware, HumanInTheLoopMiddleware


agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[...],
    middleware=[SummarizationMiddleware(), HumanInTheLoopMiddleware()],
)
```

## Built-in middleware

LangChain provides prebuilt middleware for common use cases:

### Summarization

Automatically summarize conversation history when approaching token limits.

<Tip>
  **Perfect for:**

  * Long-running conversations that exceed context windows
  * Multi-turn dialogues with extensive history
  * Applications where preserving full conversation context matters
</Tip>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import SummarizationMiddleware


agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[weather_tool, calculator_tool],
    middleware=[
        SummarizationMiddleware(
            model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
            max_tokens_before_summary=4000,  # Trigger summarization at 4000 tokens
            messages_to_keep=20,  # Keep last 20 messages after summary
            summary_prompt="Custom prompt for summarization...",  # Optional
        ),
    ],
)
```

<Accordion title="Configuration options">
  <ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
    Model for generating summaries
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="max_tokens_before_summary" type="number">
    Token threshold for triggering summarization
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="messages_to_keep" type="number" default="20">
    Recent messages to preserve
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="token_counter" type="function">
    Custom token counting function. Defaults to character-based counting.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="summary_prompt" type="string">
    Custom prompt template. Uses built-in template if not specified.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="summary_prefix" type="string" default="## Previous conversation summary:">
    Prefix for summary messages
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

### Human-in-the-loop

Pause agent execution for human approval, editing, or rejection of tool calls before they execute.

<Tip>
  **Perfect for:**

  * High-stakes operations requiring human approval (database writes, financial transactions)
  * Compliance workflows where human oversight is mandatory
  * Long running conversations where human feedback is used to guide the agent
</Tip>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import HumanInTheLoopMiddleware
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver


agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[read_email_tool, send_email_tool],
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(),
    middleware=[
        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(
            interrupt_on={
                # Require approval, editing, or rejection for sending emails
                "send_email_tool": {
                    "allowed_decisions": ["approve", "edit", "reject"],
                },
                # Auto-approve reading emails
                "read_email_tool": False,
            }
        ),
    ],
)
```

<Accordion title="Configuration options">
  <ParamField body="interrupt_on" type="dict" required>
    Mapping of tool names to approval configs. Values can be `True` (interrupt with default config), `False` (auto-approve), or an `InterruptOnConfig` object.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="description_prefix" type="string" default="Tool execution requires approval">
    Prefix for action request descriptions
  </ParamField>

  **`InterruptOnConfig` options:**

  <ParamField body="allowed_decisions" type="list[string]">
    List of allowed decisions: `"approve"`, `"edit"`, or `"reject"`
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="description" type="string | callable">
    Static string or callable function for custom description
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

<Note>
  **Important:** Human-in-the-loop middleware requires a [checkpointer](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpoints) to maintain state across interruptions.

  See the [human-in-the-loop documentation](/oss/python/langchain/human-in-the-loop) for complete examples and integration patterns.
</Note>

### Anthropic prompt caching

Reduce costs by caching repetitive prompt prefixes with Anthropic models.

<Tip>
  **Perfect for:**

  * Applications with long, repeated system prompts
  * Agents that reuse the same context across invocations
  * Reducing API costs for high-volume deployments
</Tip>

<Info>
  Learn more about [Anthropic Prompt Caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#cache-limitations) strategies and limitations.
</Info>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_anthropic.middleware import AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware
from langchain.agents import create_agent


LONG_PROMPT = """
Please be a helpful assistant.

<Lots more context ...>
"""

agent = create_agent(
    model=ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-latest"),
    system_prompt=LONG_PROMPT,
    middleware=[AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware(ttl="5m")],
)

# cache store
agent.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi, my name is Bob")]})

  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

### Model call limit

Limit the number of model calls to prevent infinite loops or excessive costs.

<Tip>
  **Perfect for:**

  * Preventing runaway agents from making too many API calls
  * Enforcing cost controls on production deployments
  * Testing agent behavior within specific call budgets
</Tip>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent

</Tip>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import ToolCallLimitMiddleware


# Limit all tool calls
global_limiter = ToolCallLimitMiddleware(thread_limit=20, run_limit=10)

# Limit specific tool
search_limiter = ToolCallLimitMiddleware(
    tool_name="search",
    thread_limit=5,
    run_limit=3,

  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

### Model fallback

Automatically fallback to alternative models when the primary model fails.

<Tip>
  **Perfect for:**

  * Building resilient agents that handle model outages
  * Cost optimization by falling back to cheaper models
  * Provider redundancy across OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
</Tip>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import ModelFallbackMiddleware


agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",  # Primary model
    tools=[...],

## Custom middleware

Build custom middleware by implementing hooks that run at specific points in the agent execution flow.

You can create middleware in two ways:

1. **Decorator-based** - Quick and simple for single-hook middleware
2. **Class-based** - More powerful for complex middleware with multiple hooks

## Decorator-based middleware

For simple middleware that only needs a single hook, decorators provide the quickest way to add functionality:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import before_model, after_model, wrap_model_call
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentState, ModelRequest, ModelResponse, dynamic_prompt
from langchain.messages import AIMessage
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from typing import Any, Callable


# Node-style: logging before model calls
@before_model
def log_before_model(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    print(f"About to call model with {len(state['messages'])} messages")
    return None

# Node-style: validation after model calls
@after_model(can_jump_to=["end"])
def validate_output(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if "BLOCKED" in last_message.content:
        return {
            "messages": [AIMessage("I cannot respond to that request.")],
            "jump_to": "end"
        }
    return None

# Wrap-style: retry logic
@wrap_model_call
def retry_model(
    request: ModelRequest,
    handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse],
) -> ModelResponse:
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            return handler(request)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == 2:
                raise
            print(f"Retry {attempt + 1}/3 after error: {e}")

# Wrap-style: dynamic prompts
@dynamic_prompt
def personalized_prompt(request: ModelRequest) -> str:
    user_id = request.runtime.context.get("user_id", "guest")
    return f"You are a helpful assistant for user {user_id}. Be concise and friendly."

# Use decorators in agent
agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    middleware=[log_before_model, validate_output, retry_model, personalized_prompt],
    tools=[...],
)
```

### Available decorators

**Node-style** (run at specific execution points):

* `@before_agent` - Before agent starts (once per invocation)
* [`@before_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.before_model) - Before each model call
* [`@after_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.after_model) - After each model response
* `@after_agent` - After agent completes (once per invocation)

**Wrap-style** (intercept and control execution):

* [`@wrap_model_call`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.wrap_model_call) - Around each model call
* [`@wrap_tool_call`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.wrap_tool_call) - Around each tool call

**Convenience decorators**:

* [`@dynamic_prompt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.dynamic_prompt) - Generates dynamic system prompts (equivalent to [`@wrap_model_call`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.wrap_model_call) that modifies the prompt)

## Class-based middleware

### Two hook styles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node-style hooks" icon="diagram-project">
    Run sequentially at specific execution points. Use for logging, validation, and state updates.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Wrap-style hooks" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Intercept execution with full control over handler calls. Use for retries, caching, and transformation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Node-style hooks

Run at specific points in the execution flow:

* `before_agent` - Before agent starts (once per invocation)
* `before_model` - Before each model call
* `after_model` - After each model response
* `after_agent` - After agent completes (up to once per invocation)

**Example: Logging middleware**

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, AgentState
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from typing import Any

class LoggingMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def before_model(self, state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        print(f"About to call model with {len(state['messages'])} messages")
        return None

    def after_model(self, state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        print(f"Model returned: {state['messages'][-1].content}")
        return None
```

**Example: Conversation length limit**

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, AgentState
from langchain.messages import AIMessage
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from typing import Any

class MessageLimitMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def __init__(self, max_messages: int = 50):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_messages = max_messages

    def before_model(self, state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        if len(state["messages"]) == self.max_messages:
            return {
                "messages": [AIMessage("Conversation limit reached.")],
                "jump_to": "end"
            }
        return None
```

#### Wrap-style hooks

Intercept execution and control when the handler is called:

* `wrap_model_call` - Around each model call
* `wrap_tool_call` - Around each tool call

You decide if the handler is called zero times (short-circuit), once (normal flow), or multiple times (retry logic).

**Example: Model retry middleware**

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, ModelRequest, ModelResponse
from typing import Callable

class RetryMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def __init__(self, max_retries: int = 3):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_retries = max_retries

    def wrap_model_call(
        self,
        request: ModelRequest,
        handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse],
    ) -> ModelResponse:
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            try:
                return handler(request)
            except Exception as e:
                if attempt == self.max_retries - 1:
                    raise
                print(f"Retry {attempt + 1}/{self.max_retries} after error: {e}")
```

**Example: Dynamic model selection**

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, ModelRequest, ModelResponse
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from typing import Callable

class DynamicModelMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def wrap_model_call(
        self,
        request: ModelRequest,
        handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse],
    ) -> ModelResponse:
        # Use different model based on conversation length
        if len(request.messages) > 10:
            request.model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4o")
        else:
            request.model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4o-mini")

        return handler(request)
```

**Example: Tool call monitoring**

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.tools.tool_node import ToolCallRequest
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langgraph.types import Command
from typing import Callable

class ToolMonitoringMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def wrap_tool_call(
        self,
        request: ToolCallRequest,
        handler: Callable[[ToolCallRequest], ToolMessage | Command],
    ) -> ToolMessage | Command:
        print(f"Executing tool: {request.tool_call['name']}")
        print(f"Arguments: {request.tool_call['args']}")

        try:
            result = handler(request)
            print(f"Tool completed successfully")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Tool failed: {e}")
            raise
```

### Custom state schema

Middleware can extend the agent's state with custom properties. Define a custom state type and set it as the `state_schema`:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentState, AgentMiddleware
from typing_extensions import NotRequired
from typing import Any

class CustomState(AgentState):
    model_call_count: NotRequired[int]
    user_id: NotRequired[str]

class CallCounterMiddleware(AgentMiddleware[CustomState]):
    state_schema = CustomState

    def before_model(self, state: CustomState, runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        # Access custom state properties
        count = state.get("model_call_count", 0)

        if count > 10:
            return {"jump_to": "end"}

        return None

    def after_model(self, state: CustomState, runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        # Update custom state
        return {"model_call_count": state.get("model_call_count", 0) + 1}
```

```python  theme={null}
agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    middleware=[CallCounterMiddleware()],
    tools=[...],
)

# Invoke with custom state
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage("Hello")],
    "model_call_count": 0,
    "user_id": "user-123",
})
```

### Execution order

When using multiple middleware, understanding execution order is important:

```python  theme={null}
agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    middleware=[middleware1, middleware2, middleware3],
    tools=[...],
)
```

<Accordion title="Execution flow (click to expand)">
  **Before hooks run in order:**

  1. `middleware1.before_agent()`
  2. `middleware2.before_agent()`
  3. `middleware3.before_agent()`

  **Agent loop starts**

  5. `middleware1.before_model()`
  6. `middleware2.before_model()`
  7. `middleware3.before_model()`

  **Wrap hooks nest like function calls:**

  8. `middleware1.wrap_model_call()` → `middleware2.wrap_model_call()` → `middleware3.wrap_model_call()` → model

  **After hooks run in reverse order:**

  9. `middleware3.after_model()`
  10. `middleware2.after_model()`
  11. `middleware1.after_model()`

  **Agent loop ends**

  13. `middleware3.after_agent()`
  14. `middleware2.after_agent()`
  15. `middleware1.after_agent()`
</Accordion>

**Key rules:**

* `before_*` hooks: First to last
* `after_*` hooks: Last to first (reverse)
* `wrap_*` hooks: Nested (first middleware wraps all others)

### Agent jumps

To exit early from middleware, return a dictionary with `jump_to`:

```python  theme={null}
class EarlyExitMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def before_model(self, state: AgentState, runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        # Check some condition
        if should_exit(state):
            return {
                "messages": [AIMessage("Exiting early due to condition.")],
                "jump_to": "end"
            }
        return None
```

Available jump targets:

* `"end"`: Jump to the end of the agent execution
* `"tools"`: Jump to the tools node
* `"model"`: Jump to the model node (or the first `before_model` hook)

**Important:** When jumping from `before_model` or `after_model`, jumping to `"model"` will cause all `before_model` middleware to run again.

To enable jumping, decorate your hook with `@hook_config(can_jump_to=[...])`:

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, hook_config
from typing import Any

class ConditionalMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    @hook_config(can_jump_to=["end", "tools"])
    def after_model(self, state: AgentState, runtime) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        if some_condition(state):
            return {"jump_to": "end"}
        return None
```

### Best practices

1. Keep middleware focused - each should do one thing well
2. Handle errors gracefully - don't let middleware errors crash the agent
3. **Use appropriate hook types**:
   * Node-style for sequential logic (logging, validation)
   * Wrap-style for control flow (retry, fallback, caching)
4. Clearly document any custom state properties
5. Unit test middleware independently before integrating
6. Consider execution order - place critical middleware first in the list
7. Use built-in middleware when possible, don't reinvent the wheel :)

## Examples

### Dynamically selecting tools

Select relevant tools at runtime to improve performance and accuracy.

<Tip>
  **Benefits:**

  * **Shorter prompts** - Reduce complexity by exposing only relevant tools
  * **Better accuracy** - Models choose correctly from fewer options
  * **Permission control** - Dynamically filter tools based on user access
</Tip>

```python  theme={null}
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, ModelRequest
from typing import Callable


class ToolSelectorMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def wrap_model_call(
        self,
        request: ModelRequest,
        handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse],
    ) -> ModelResponse:
        """Middleware to select relevant tools based on state/context."""
        # Select a small, relevant subset of tools based on state/context
        relevant_tools = select_relevant_tools(request.state, request.runtime)
        request.tools = relevant_tools
        return handler(request)

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=all_tools,  # All available tools need to be registered upfront
    # Middleware can be used to select a smaller subset that's relevant for the given run.
    middleware=[ToolSelectorMiddleware()],
)
```

# Structured output

Structured output allows agents to return data in a specific, predictable format. Instead of parsing natural language responses, you get structured data in the form of JSON objects, Pydantic models, or dataclasses that your application can directly use.

LangChain's [`create_agent`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) handles structured output automatically. The user sets their desired structured output schema, and when the model generates the structured data, it's captured, validated, and returned in the `'structured_response'` key of the agent's state.

```python  theme={null}
def create_agent(
    ...
    response_format: Union[
        ToolStrategy[StructuredResponseT],
        ProviderStrategy[StructuredResponseT],
        type[StructuredResponseT],
    ]
```

## Response Format

Controls how the agent returns structured data:

* **`ToolStrategy[StructuredResponseT]`**: Uses tool calling for structured output
* **`ProviderStrategy[StructuredResponseT]`**: Uses provider-native structured output
* **`type[StructuredResponseT]`**: Schema type - automatically selects best strategy based on model capabilities
* **`None`**: No structured output

When a schema type is provided directly, LangChain automatically chooses:

* `ProviderStrategy` for models supporting native structured output (e.g. [OpenAI](/oss/python/integrations/providers/openai), [Grok](/oss/python/integrations/providers/xai))
* `ToolStrategy` for all other models

The structured response is returned in the `structured_response` key of the agent's final state.

## Provider strategy

Some model providers support structured output natively through their APIs (currently only OpenAI and Grok). This is the most reliable method when available.

To use this strategy, configure a `ProviderStrategy`:

```python  theme={null}
class ProviderStrategy(Generic[SchemaT]):
    schema: type[SchemaT]
```

<ParamField path="schema" required>
  The schema defining the structured output format. Supports:

  * **Pydantic models**: `BaseModel` subclasses with field validation
  * **Dataclasses**: Python dataclasses with type annotations
  * **TypedDict**: Typed dictionary classes
  * **JSON Schema**: Dictionary with JSON schema specification
</ParamField>

LangChain automatically uses `ProviderStrategy` when you pass a schema type directly to [`create_agent.response_format`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent\(response_format\)) and the model supports native structured output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Pydantic Model theme={null}
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  from langchain.agents import create_agent


  class ContactInfo(BaseModel):
      """Contact information for a person."""
      name: str = Field(description="The name of the person")
      email: str = Field(description="The email address of the person")
      phone: str = Field(description="The phone number of the person")

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5",
      tools=tools,
      response_format=ContactInfo  # Auto-selects ProviderStrategy
  )

  result = agent.invoke({
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract contact info from: John Doe, john@example.com, (555) 123-4567"}]
  })

  result["structured_response"]
  # ContactInfo(name='John Doe', email='john@example.com', phone='(555) 123-4567')
  ```

  ```python Dataclass theme={null}
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from langchain.agents import create_agent


  @dataclass
  class ContactInfo:
      """Contact information for a person."""
      name: str # The name of the person
      email: str # The email address of the person
      phone: str # The phone number of the person

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5",
      tools=tools,
      response_format=ContactInfo  # Auto-selects ProviderStrategy
  )

  result = agent.invoke({
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract contact info from: John Doe, john@example.com, (555) 123-4567"}]
  })

  result["structured_response"]
  # ContactInfo(name='John Doe', email='john@example.com', phone='(555) 123-4567')
  ```

  ```python TypedDict theme={null}
  from typing_extensions import TypedDict
  from langchain.agents import create_agent


  class ContactInfo(TypedDict):
      """Contact information for a person."""
      name: str # The name of the person
      email: str # The email address of the person
      phone: str # The phone number of the person

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5",
      tools=tools,
      response_format=ContactInfo  # Auto-selects ProviderStrategy
  )

  result = agent.invoke({
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract contact info from: John Doe, john@example.com, (555) 123-4567"}]
  })

  result["structured_response"]
  # {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com', 'phone': '(555) 123-4567'}
  ```

  ```python JSON Schema theme={null}
  from langchain.agents import create_agent


  contact_info_schema = {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Contact information for a person.",
      "properties": {
          "name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the person"},
          "email": {"type": "string", "description": "The email address of the person"},
          "phone": {"type": "string", "description": "The phone number of the person"}
      },
      "required": ["name", "email", "phone"]
  }

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5",
      tools=tools,
      response_format=contact_info_schema  # Auto-selects ProviderStrategy
  )

  result = agent.invoke({
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract contact info from: John Doe, john@example.com, (555) 123-4567"}]
  })

  result["structured_response"]
  # {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com', 'phone': '(555) 123-4567'}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Provider-native structured output provides high reliability and strict validation because the model provider enforces the schema. Use it when available.

<Note>
  If the provider natively supports structured output for your model choice, it is functionally equivalent to write `response_format=ProductReview` instead of `response_format=ToolStrategy(ProductReview)`. In either case, if structured output is not supported, the agent will fall back to a tool calling strategy.
</Note>

## Tool calling strategy

For models that don't support native structured output, LangChain uses tool calling to achieve the same result. This works with all models that support tool calling, which is most modern models.

To use this strategy, configure a `ToolStrategy`:

```python  theme={null}
class ToolStrategy(Generic[SchemaT]):
    schema: type[SchemaT]
    tool_message_content: str | None
    handle_errors: Union[
        bool,
        str,
        type[Exception],
        tuple[type[Exception], ...],
        Callable[[Exception], str],
    ]
```

<ParamField path="schema" required>
  The schema defining the structured output format. Supports:

  * **Pydantic models**: `BaseModel` subclasses with field validation
  * **Dataclasses**: Python dataclasses with type annotations
  * **TypedDict**: Typed dictionary classes
  * **JSON Schema**: Dictionary with JSON schema specification
  * **Union types**: Multiple schema options. The model will choose the most appropriate schema based on the context.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tool_message_content">
  Custom content for the tool message returned when structured output is generated.
  If not provided, defaults to a message showing the structured response data.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="handle_errors">
  Error handling strategy for structured output validation failures. Defaults to `True`.

  * **`True`**: Catch all errors with default error template
  * **`str`**: Catch all errors with this custom message
  * **`type[Exception]`**: Only catch this exception type with default message
  * **`tuple[type[Exception], ...]`**: Only catch these exception types with default message
  * **`Callable[[Exception], str]`**: Custom function that returns error message
  * **`False`**: No retry, let exceptions propagate
</ParamField>

### Custom tool message content

The `tool_message_content` parameter allows you to customize the message that appears in the conversation history when structured output is generated:

```python  theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy


class MeetingAction(BaseModel):
    """Action items extracted from a meeting transcript."""
    task: str = Field(description="The specific task to be completed")
    assignee: str = Field(description="Person responsible for the task")
    priority: Literal["low", "medium", "high"] = Field(description="Priority level")

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5",
    tools=[],
    response_format=ToolStrategy(
        schema=MeetingAction,
        tool_message_content="Action item captured and added to meeting notes!"
    )
)

agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "From our meeting: Sarah needs to update the project timeline as soon as possible"}]
})
```

```
================================ Human Message =================================

From our meeting: Sarah needs to update the project timeline as soon as possible
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  MeetingAction (call_1)
 Call ID: call_1
  Args:
    task: Update the project timeline
    assignee: Sarah
    priority: high
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: MeetingAction

Action item captured and added to meeting notes!
```

Without `tool_message_content`, our final [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) would be:

```
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: MeetingAction

Returning structured response: {'task': 'update the project timeline', 'assignee': 'Sarah', 'priority': 'high'}
```

### Error handling

Models can make mistakes when generating structured output via tool calling. LangChain provides intelligent retry mechanisms to handle these errors automatically.

#### Multiple structured outputs error

When a model incorrectly calls multiple structured output tools, the agent provides error feedback in a [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) and prompts the model to retry:

```python  theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Union
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy


class ContactInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Person's name")
    email: str = Field(description="Email address")

class EventDetails(BaseModel):
    event_name: str = Field(description="Name of the event")
    date: str = Field(description="Event date")

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5",
    tools=[],
    response_format=ToolStrategy(Union[ContactInfo, EventDetails])  # Default: handle_errors=True
)

agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract info: John Doe (john@email.com) is organizing Tech Conference on March 15th"}]
})
```

```
================================ Human Message =================================

Extract info: John Doe (john@email.com) is organizing Tech Conference on March 15th
None
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  ContactInfo (call_1)
 Call ID: call_1
  Args:
    name: John Doe
    email: john@email.com
  EventDetails (call_2)
 Call ID: call_2
  Args:
    event_name: Tech Conference
    date: March 15th
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ContactInfo

Error: Model incorrectly returned multiple structured responses (ContactInfo, EventDetails) when only one is expected.
 Please fix your mistakes.
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: EventDetails

Error: Model incorrectly returned multiple structured responses (ContactInfo, EventDetails) when only one is expected.
 Please fix your mistakes.
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  ContactInfo (call_3)
 Call ID: call_3
  Args:
    name: John Doe
    email: john@email.com
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ContactInfo

Returning structured response: {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@email.com'}
```

#### Schema validation error

When structured output doesn't match the expected schema, the agent provides specific error feedback:

```python  theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy


class ProductRating(BaseModel):
    rating: int | None = Field(description="Rating from 1-5", ge=1, le=5)
    comment: str = Field(description="Review comment")

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-5",
    tools=[],
    response_format=ToolStrategy(ProductRating),  # Default: handle_errors=True
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant that parses product reviews. Do not make any field or value up."
)

agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Parse this: Amazing product, 10/10!"}]
})
```

```
================================ Human Message =================================

Parse this: Amazing product, 10/10!
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  ProductRating (call_1)
 Call ID: call_1
  Args:
    rating: 10
    comment: Amazing product
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ProductRating

Error: Failed to parse structured output for tool 'ProductRating': 1 validation error for ProductRating.rating
  Input should be less than or equal to 5 [type=less_than_equal, input_value=10, input_type=int].
 Please fix your mistakes.
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  ProductRating (call_2)
 Call ID: call_2
  Args:
    rating: 5
    comment: Amazing product
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ProductRating

Returning structured response: {'rating': 5, 'comment': 'Amazing product'}
```

#### Error handling strategies

You can customize how errors are handled using the `handle_errors` parameter:

**Custom error message:**

```python  theme={null}
ToolStrategy(
    schema=ProductRating,
    handle_errors="Please provide a valid rating between 1-5 and include a comment."
)
```

If `handle_errors` is a string, the agent will *always* prompt the model to re-try with a fixed tool message:

```
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ProductRating

Please provide a valid rating between 1-5 and include a comment.
```

**Handle specific exceptions only:**

```python  theme={null}
ToolStrategy(
    schema=ProductRating,
    handle_errors=ValueError  # Only retry on ValueError, raise others
)
```

If `handle_errors` is an exception type, the agent will only retry (using the default error message) if the exception raised is the specified type. In all other cases, the exception will be raised.

**Handle multiple exception types:**

```python  theme={null}
ToolStrategy(
    schema=ProductRating,
    handle_errors=(ValueError, TypeError)  # Retry on ValueError and TypeError
)
```

If `handle_errors` is a tuple of exceptions, the agent will only retry (using the default error message) if the exception raised is one of the specified types. In all other cases, the exception will be raised.

**Custom error handler function:**

```python  theme={null}
def custom_error_handler(error: Exception) -> str:
    if isinstance(error, StructuredOutputValidationError):
        return "There was an issue with the format. Try again.
    elif isinstance(error, MultipleStructuredOutputsError):
        return "Multiple structured outputs were returned. Pick the most relevant one."
    else:
        return f"Error: {str(error)}"

ToolStrategy(
    schema=ToolStrategy(Union[ContactInfo, EventDetails]),
    handle_errors=custom_error_handler
)
```

On `StructuredOutputValidationError`:

```
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ToolStrategy

There was an issue with the format. Try again.
```

On `MultipleStructuredOutputsError`:

```
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ToolStrategy

Multiple structured outputs were returned. Pick the most relevant one.
```

On other errors:

```
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ToolStrategy

Error: <error message>
```

**No error handling:**

```python  theme={null}
response_format = ToolStrategy(
    schema=ProductRating,
    handle_errors=False  # All errors raised
)
```
